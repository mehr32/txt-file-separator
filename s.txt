In the event that the President is either killed or resigns the Vice President is a horrible choice to take over office
As an example if Obama was assassinated in late 2009 would Biden have the same level of influence necessary to gather support for the Affordable Care Act Does Biden have the same level of respect from foreign nations needed to guide the country in this global age The only half decent argument I can think of for a Vice President is to ensure that the President s general will ideology is carried out in the event of their removal from office
Secondly the Vice President is not guaranteed to adhere to the policies of their predecessor
Furthermore they do not command the same degree of loyalty and respect as the President or Speaker of the House
In Robert McNamara s documentary The Fog of War he mentions how LBJ decided to continue the Vietnam war despite JFK s efforts to move troops out
I believe that this is a weak argument for two reasons
Yes there may be conflict between the old cabinet members and the new President but the position is still somewhat representative of the country s will
The Vice President is not significantly involved with congress and does not engage in debate with representatives or Senators over legislation
The Speaker of the House would be much more qualified for the position simply because they engage more deeply with the government
First the Speaker of the House DOES represent a significant portion of the country s will given that their party has taken the majority in the House
Furthermore the ability to cast a tie breaking vote has not been invoked very often by Vice Presidents
If Boehner suddenly took office he would absolutely veto many bills Obama supported
From what I understand the only significant duty given to the Vice President is to preside over the Senate even this has been shirked by past vice presidents
I m willing to bet that John Boehner would have an easier time dealing with Congress as President than Joe Biden would due to his constant interaction with it
if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all
I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant and expecting results is hopeless
I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian lifestyle I think it s a GOOD thing by all means
For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it I get it and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing
Both of these essays approach your question in a statistics based manner that focuses on thresholds
I m trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject I try not to see individuals as evil cause they think it s normal to torture animals I understand it s a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general
I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could
gt Eventually not soon but maybe in a generation or two I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat eating as has happened with social issues in recent years
I ll start off by saying I m a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts
Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data I couldn t justify changing my mind since I couldn t help but believe things are changing way too slowly and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run
But I know it ll only benefit my ethics and my self esteem
I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight there s no chance any of this will change
As of today I m making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good at peace with myself cause if I think about the contribution to the environment I m sorry but I just can t believe I m doing anything significant
but the actual contribution to things That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten
Another great argument with links gt In short the reality is It adds up
I ve been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses it was really no hassle for anyone
I know that for every person like me there are one thousand who don t give a damn
I m 100 convinced on what I ve done for a year now and I ll become as vegan as possible in the future I m NOT looking for an excuse to quit
And at that point changes will be sweeping and sudden
I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind
but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they d be throwing away that day
maybe it would have been better saved the cook some work
It s a fantastic feeling it s healthy and a million other things
I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn t change things a bit
I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there s something to look for behind the hard numbers
On the eating leftovers thing I also have to add
When there are leftovers from dinners with guests etc
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
In other words they ask questions like What are the odds that your purchase of say a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I have never thought about critical mass
They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability
As I said I haven t stopped believing in the lifestyle and I ll never quit
Al Franken went on Jon Stewart and said it was ridiculous for a politician to be against a law that prevents students from bullying gay people
Stewart asked him what the Republicans said is their reason
People laughed because well obviously LGBTQ people get bullied waayyy more than their counterparts so they need to be specially protected
It seems pretty obvious you shouldn t beat up someone because they re gay but you really shouldn t beat up anyone
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
The issue with the entire concept of protective classes is that they only protect the alpha minorities while leaving everyone else in the dust
While heterosexuals students may get beaten up a lot less on average I m sure we could identify groups within heterosexuals that should be protected from bullying
Any group that can get national and consistent attention can get protected
Franken dismissively responded they don t believe anyone should be bullied
In the 1960s the Civil Rights Act passed on the same tune a group banded together and they pushed for social change
The LGBTQ community is considerably more organized and properly defined they ve banded together and pushed serious change in policy in the last decade
It s exclusion masquerading as inclusion it goes as far as to split the world into three groups normal protected and fucked
Obviously adding nerds to the list of protective classes is ridiculous
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Stewart s crowd ate it up
I think Miley s comments to the press were respectful articulate and accurate
I also feel like Nicki and Beyoncé are two strong examples of non white women who are both celebrated for their contributions to the music industry and are regarded widely as extremely sexy
Statistically it s completely reasonable for there to be years where an award with fewer than ten nominees have no black female nominees
She s a pop star and sex symbol nobody is body shaming her and if they are not nominating her for an award doesn t count
So to recap Anaconda didn t get nominated for best video Nicki went on Twitter and basically said that it didn t get nominated because she s a curvy black woman and implied that if she were a skinny white girl like tailor swift she would have been nominated
For this reason I think that people calling it body shaming that Nicki wasn t nominated is ridiculous
I ll be honest with you I didn t even know about this whole thing until this morning
I do think Nicki has a point that black women and black men contribute a lot to pop culture and aren t recognized for it but I think they aren t recognized because it s the average black person that creates more culture than a few celebs
Frankly before this incident I respected Nicki way more than Miley but I ve lost some respect for Nicki and gained some for Miley
She called Nicki not polite and not very nice in her statements about the nominations
We don t give out awards for segment of the population that most contributed to pop culture this year
I saw a whole bunch of posts on tumblr like I hate Miley so much Miley needs to check her white privilege I respect Nicki so much for how she handled that
Miley then said we are all in the same industry we all do interviews we all know how they manipulate things congratulations on your award
I think Nicki s comments on Twitter came across as petty and I also think they were inaccurate
So I went on ye olde Google and in ten seconds found the transcript of the Miley interview and I video of their exchange at the VMAs
Miley then says in an interview that she could have respected what Nicki said if it was said in a different less angry way but couldn t because of the way she presented her points
Then during the VMAs Nicki said back to the bitch that had a lot to say about me in the press a few days ago then said something along the lines of what you got
I think the way she handled the VMAs was immature and only served to detract from her point by diminishing her credibility
I m willing to award deltas both for objective proof that black women specifically are snubbed in the music industry and for persuading me that Nicki s comments at the VMAs were justified Miley was in the wrong in the situation in terms of the way she approached the problem
I also feel like it makes sense that there aren t as many black women who are famous and receiving awards because well there are way fewer black women than black men white men white women and all other gender ethnicity combinations combined
I think she handled the VMA situation maturely
I wanted to post this because a common suggestion for men when it comes to online dating is to never talk about games unless the woman specifically starts talking about it
I can understand the frustation if all your messages are about that one thing
In that case the obvious interpretation specially when it s a shared interest is that it s a great way to start a conversation
It shows you have something in common it shows you ve read the profile bothered to make a customized message instead of copy pasta
But then I can t really blame anyone that goes for it specially when it s something that s so popular like gaming
But just going EVERYONE MESSAGES ME ABOUT CATS WHY ARE lt men women gt SO PREDICTABLE UGH SEND SOMETHING ORIGINAL is absurdly counter productive but seems to be what most people think when that happens
Maybe mention cats somewhere along the conversation
You can t go to a bakery say I LOVE BREAD and then complain everyone around you is trying to sell bread but you actually want someone to offer you a drink instead
All things that are supposedly good
Heck right now on r OkCupid there s a thread with a woman s profile complaining about people asking her what games she plays when she outright says she s interested in people that plays games on her profile
If I write in my profile I love cats if you love cats too send a message what the hell should I expect if not a lot of Hey I like cats too How many cats do you own and so on If it gets to the point where most messages I receive are about cats and I m tired of that subject damn the most obvious thing to do is remove that from the profile
It s an instant way to try and generate some rapport and start a conversation
Standing out from the rest is something you should strive for
CMV _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Now this is an extreme case and the logic behind that advice is actually quite solid Women that mention gaming probably get a bunch of messages like Sup gal I like games too What games do you play which can absolutely become annoying over time
If you send a message like that you re not doing much to differentiate from the dozens of other guys sending the exact same thing
Just take the cat pictures out of your profile and you can go back to receiving some hey bab ur htoooot every other message instead
EVEN if her profile mentions gaming
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Now here s the catch however If it s explicitly mentioned on her profile as an interest hobby or w e it can be assumed it s something she likes and cares about
The government used fear from its citizens to support the creation of a pointless government agency after pressure from the unions who wanted more jobs
Also some important information to keep in mind is that the TSA has never once stopped a terrorist attack
After September 11th the TSA was created because people were afraid and because the union needed jobs
I m not saying that we don t need airport security but we obviously do not need 47 000 TSA officers

Obviously this still isn t very efficient because drivers waiting in line would have to wait for the car at the closest pump to clear out of the way before any of the pumps that follow become available
Consider a gas station with two places to enter the station lot and a single line of pumps that can serve vehicles on either shoulder of the line
Drivers can enter through either entrance and will wait in line until the closest pump in front of them becomes available
Allowing vehicles to reverse into the spots from the other end of the line of pumps traps all other cars that were already fueling and so I argue that the stations would have the effective option of requiring drivers to not reverse into spots
Obviously each station s lot will be unique and so disallowing drivers to reverse into lanes might not make sense but I argue that having the drivers be able anticipate exactly how other drivers will have to maneuver into each spot will still be an improvement
The side of the car that the cap is on would vary from country to country since which side of the vehicle is the driver side is not a global constant
If cars can be made with the steering wheel on opposite sides of the vehicle I have no doubt that it is possible to switch the side of the car that the gas cap is on
Additionally stations can impose forward only driving to see massive improvements in some cases
Some gas stations are wide enough to allow drivers to parallel park into each spot at the pump
However this extra space could be used to add additional lanes of pumps in the future
Cars will queue up on either end of the isle of pumps and so drivers will have to deal with other cars pointed in the opposite direction as them
Under the proposed solution there will only be two lanes of vehicles instead what currently has the potential to be 4
Note that I make no argument for exactly how this new trend should be done whether it be by convention law or other regulation
Anybody who as ever had to get gas at a busy station knows what a pain it is to deal with all the drivers that are trying to get into a spot where the fuel hoses can reach their gas caps
My argument if all vehicles have their gas caps on the same side of the vehicle gas stations can increase the rate at which customers are served at the pumps
Exits become clogged as drivers enter the station in opposing directions
As crazy as this title sounds I really don t see anything wrong with it obviously unless it s your friend it s not your responsibility to keep other peoples girlfriend s faithful if they are going to sleep with you they are probably going to sleep with somebody else anyway also I wouldn t want to be with somebody who would have slept with another guy but because he didn t want to in the end she didn t
I wouldn t blame the other guy at all she is the only one to blame imo regardless of wether he talked her into it or not he shouldn t be able to anyway
It would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn t a case so I look forward to someone convincing me
But on a practical level I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home except that in the former I d have to go out of my way to perform additional actions
This is a classic example of a and after considering this class of problems thoroughly I ve come to the conclusion that there is no self interested practical reason to participate in these cases barring external motivators
If I m trying to decide whether to perform those actions based on pure self interest there is no reason for me to vote
I admit there can be other reasons to vote social pressure solidarity civic pride etc
By practical reason I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election
I m setting this at the level of national elections because it s true that given a small enough nation your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference
There is a difference between I disagree and you re not contributing
Even subreddits with heavy handed anti downvote policies still see lots of downvotes
I feel sorry for anyone who shares an IP address with a firebrand redditor
The reddiquette says don t downvote just because you disagree
Almost every language can differentiate the two
However getting heavily downvoted still hurts feelings and can result in quota issues
Lots of users write posts and intend to use the karma as a poll of sorts with upvotes as Yes and downvotes as No
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
However there are tons of posts on almost any subreddit with zero or negative karma and many of these are insightful and friendly but are minority opinions
Try again in 9 minutes messages
There needs to be a way for redditors to communicate philosophical disagreement separately and independently from believing a post is worthless or antisocial
I have several verified email accounts but still get you are doing that too much
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime
I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have
If you weigh 500 pounds but you re incredibly smart you can still make a contribution to society
We are not advancing as a race
I will not give up easily
We also allow these morbidly obese incredibly stupid people live and breed
We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well
_____ Alright so i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely i will only do so if you can actually change my mind
For those who are unaware my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren t aware of who actually killed the person so they don t have trouble with living life after killing someone
The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution
My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this though I haven t had the time to think too much into that this I am very open to other ideas on
this should be easy for anyone who isn t morbidly obese
Tests will vary depending on your age the older you get the harder they become until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required
Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday
Many will be angry that it s giving more power to the rich but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society
yes this sounds harsh but let me explain why
What the tests will consist of The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math your ability to read and write and your basic understanding of the sciences
These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone
Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly
Lastly there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY the main one being in the military
The cost will be 25 000 per year per person
AN IMPORTANT NOTE You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests
If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins triplets or even more you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn t your intent to have that many
The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad
At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65
8 men 2 with real bullets to ensure death 6 with blanks for the obvious reason
Another massive problem we are facing is over population we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates
I believe I can change this country better yet this world for the better
People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn t want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating
There will be three tests a mental test a physical test and a psychological test
I personally believe that we should execute the weak
This is all i can think of for now if i remember more of my plan i will post
Now another thing i would like to do that isn t executing people but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children
Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group
If an animal in the wild isn t fit or cannot attract a mate it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics
There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age
When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized
The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society
I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i ll continue on later
For the physical test every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes
Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it
These people will not be allowed to produce offspring however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children
We allow shitty genetics to be passed on
There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you re just putting a burden on society
The maximum number of children a person may have is 3 which is a very reasonable amount
More importantly that human is allowed to procreate
If you are rich I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway
You look at animals and if an animal doesn t want to eat it dies if a human doesn t want to eat it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder
It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child
So reddit users change my view
This test should not be difficult anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine
People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized
Now to determine who is to be executed
This is a very easy time to make you can walk that pace
Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children which fucks with the gene pool
For now though we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on
The opposite is also true if you re borderline retarded but you re very physically fit you can also contribute to society
What will determine who is executed At the age of 14 years old annual testing will begin based on birthday
How we will execute people We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people
Your actual writing may be poor but your criticism is still good
In no particular order of extremity or badness here are all of his transgressions that I can think of at the moment He frequently insults his subjects and cruelly makes attacks on their personal lives
Half of these examples appear to be quite literally jokes which is either evidence that he doesn t respect the people he s reviewing or he doesn t respect his job as a critic
In his review of the Rolling Stones by Sonic Youth he calls Steel Wheels immortal
Forming your opinions based on what the art is trying to achieve rather than what you desire
There are probably more but those are the basics and no matter how many requirements you set up it ultimately doesn t matter because Christgau violates every last one
Basically avoid ad hominem attacks both because you re an art critic and not a people critic and because it s highly unprofessional
don t criticize Hamlet for being sad
His ratings often have very poor arbitrary justifications
Perhaps this is ultimately unnecessary but surely to be a music critic you should have an actual interest if not a passion in the music you critique I mean imagine the outrage there would be if Roger Ebert confessed after winning his Pulitzer Prize that he thinks the entire medium of film is boring
Some examples his review of by the Fall the former of which means nothing and the second of which contains no reasoning for its judgment
The definition of a critic is simple a person who judges the merits of literary artistic or musical works especially one who does so professionally
As long as you fulfill those requirements you are essentially doing the job of a critic
However a critic s tastes shouldn t be constantly jumping around or they become unreliable and arbitrary
Isn t that high praise for a B when you ve given them A s and A s before Christgau sometimes goes so far as to outright not review an artist s music
To make this argument I ll first lay out what I think we collectively expect from a critic
He does this in a negative way with his review of by the Strokes in which he dedicates the start of the review to figuring out which 60s 70s punk band he thinks it sounds like and when he settles on the Vibrators he spends the rest of the review describing them
However there are a few further elements which though arguable also help Criticising not the artist but his art
There are many more examples of this but I feel these are egregious enough to demonstrate his tendencies
His reviews often consist of so much jargon that they are nearly or completely incomprehensible and even those not containing jargon can be hard or impossible to parse
Does Christgau really think somebody reading a review for the Strokes wants to instead read a review of a band two decades older and part of a different genre He insults fans of artists he doesn t like which is needless to say a very immature move for somebody who is allegedly an esteemed critic
In short he fails to be a good critic more often than he succeeds and is therefore bad
This is because in truth what a good critic does goes beyond that basic definition
As far as I can tell that concludes my issues with Robert Christgau
Here are a few of what I see as commonly agreed upon methods of good criticism They make their opinions on the work clear
They provide a justification for those opinions based on the work so that they are credible
It s a tragedy and is meant to be sad so that means it succeeds in what it s doing
Perhaps most famous but also most innocuous is his inexplicable hatred for Jim Morrison describing him in his review of by Interpol made all the more unnecessary by the fact that he s not even reviewing Ian Curtis music he just felt the review needed some kind of offensive flair to generate interest apparently
What kind of reasoning is that Is Christgau really so beholden to others that he can t even state his true opinions on an album Finally he outright states in his review of by Public Image Ltd that he doesn t even like rock music or rock criticism
In summary his reviews often state their judgments in an unclear manner
In this way he fails to fulfill his duties as a critic and is thus bad at his job
That is you call the music idiotic but you don t call the muscians idiots
To be clear I m not saying that all of his reviews violate all of these criteria but that he fails at least one of them in seemingly every review I ve seen of his and that those few reviews in which he doesn t are so rare as to constitute only a tiny fraction of his critical output
Was it necessary in his review of by Nick Cave amp the Bad Seeds to call his fans cultists and insult their taste in lyrics Whether or not he s right he s supposed to be reviewing the music and not the people who listen to it
In those cases when they don t the judgments often have little to no reasoning to back them up and are further marred by a variety of problems such as engaging in ad hominem attacks on both the musicians and their fans
Now to get onto his actual mistakes
I m not arguing whether he qualifies as a critic or not I m arguing that he is bad at being a critic
The best example is probably his review of by Captain Beefheart which he says he wants to give an A but won t because it s just too weird
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Those are the most vital two
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Consistency isn t required especially if a critic has a long career like Christgau s and thus their outlook changes over the years
Removing stroke based disciplines would also reduce the disproportionate number of medals awarded in swimming while allowing for the women s 1500m which is often rejected on the grounds that there are already enough swimming events
Since there is a large category of environments in which classic technique is superior it makes sense to have a separate discipline instead of trying to control the environment and have athletes decide on a mixture of techniques at the last minute without adequate information
Swimming competitions test who can propel themselves a fixed distance in deep water in the shortest time
This is obviously an important athletic feat
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
However if there is any environment in which backstroke breaststroke or butterfly is superior to the front crawl it is completely unlike the format in which they are currently contested
For example in cross country skiing the classic technique is slower than the skate technique used in freestyle competition
Contesting strokes other than freestyle however artificially forces athletes to perform a task using a subpar means of accomplishing that task
One might as well have athletics events in skipping handstand walking bunnyhopping etc
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
However the skate technique requires more extensive surface preparation
If the other strokes have some advantage then they should be contested in a context where those benefits are apparent and or scored instead of one where the offer no benefit whatsoever
Since we d have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused since they d not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech
Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear
Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about
Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren t would be a very difficult one to make
My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful
An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is xe xer xerself or zi zis zimself
My argument is as follows 1
The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns
If we d decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non standard gender identities we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns
A he can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women
The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
The singular they is also covering a spectrum the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees
Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum
As for konami They re basically done with console gaming all together so they couldn t care less what gamers think about them at this point in time
And they just know theirs absolutely no way in hell people are going to skip out on Kojima s last metal gear solid game
Maybe I m being to cynical and things will be okay Because if I am please convince me because things look very dire from my point of view
But guess what It won t
You see it wouldn t be a problem if I could just say boycotting would work
Thats why you should always double check before submitting folks Edit 2 Yeah I d say my view has been changed on the subject
I clarified more about that in the comments
Thats why they re pulling this shit to begin with
And don t say I m just going to wait for it to go on sale HA Lets be real here no you re not
Edit And I screwed up the title
Seriously guys I have no idea what the hell we can do and I fear its only a matter of time before other publishers follow suite
I can boycott this game and then never have another deus ex game for god knows how long or I just shut the fuck up and buy it near launch
And they know this damn well
You ll say you will in the comments but you ll fall to the temptation
And no buying it 2 years down the line won t help the series because square enix have already proven they only care about the short term sales
Deus Ex is a niche but brilliant series and it wouldn t take much for the series to go back to sleep for another decade due to lack of sales
So what are they doing They re squeezing out as much as they possibly can out of us by doing the most lazy sleazy shit this industry has seen in quite a long time
So with konami doing everything in there power to ruin MGSV and now square enix I thought it was about time I brought out an issue and why it angers me so
And both konami and square enix knows this
Maybe they have trouble speaking or recognizing faces or maybe their personality is drastically altered
Edit It seems like my main criticism is that claiming something with certainty is inherently more ignorant that at least admitting something to be a possibility
He doesn t really have any strong theological beliefs but he believes there will always be more to our reality than what can be measured and by extension doesn t find it absurd for someone to believe in life after death
I argue that we know enough in this modern age to dismiss that belief
We study the microscopic world that composes us observe that everything seems to operate on static laws
But where does this leave us We can t know ANYHTHING then Just because all of our knowledge of the universe is acquired through inductive reasoning doesn t mean we can hold on to these irrational beliefs
He says that I m the arrogant one for claiming with certainty that we shouldn t believe in things beyond the measurable
People have strokes and lose a huge chunk of their personhood
It s just human arrogance to believe we re special in some way and can transcend this universe full of non living parts
Regardless it s clear that we re the product of PHYSICAL interactions in the brain
maybe there s only one sentient person on the planet and the rest are robots in disguise
We re composed of the very stuff we study so conclusion we operate on the same static laws
It may be a black box but just because we don t know how the black box functions doesn t mean there might be an entirely different reality out there that would allow our true soul to move to or extend from
You can t construct some logical proof to dismiss these ideas as being utterly impossible
If one part of the brain is physically damaged the processing that occurs in that area of the brain is disrupted
If a 100 years from now we understand the brain in depth and from static principles can explain how a given structure of neurons can give rise to a certain personality or behavior then where will you put your theological beliefs If we can be explained via rules in this world why would i need to believe in anything more EDIT I guess this entire discussion is about materialism
I still view materialism physicalism as the only reasonable philosophical position but I ll retract the notion that people who believe otherwise are actually stupid
We don t exist anywhere else in any sense we are literally the structure of our neurons
This beliefs spills over into more practical matters such as him refusing to see any computer as ever being conscious regardless of it s complexity
We re a sac of complicated flesh that uses electrical gradients to process information
We may not really understand how all the neurons on our brain work together to make a fully formed human mind but we know it s an emergent property of physical parts and no more
If we re abiding by a philosophical absolute sense of certainty then anything is possible

No matter what we learn about physics and the human brain there could always be more out there that in some way would allow our being to persist even after death
He also believes that we could be living in the Matrix for instance and that might be one way for life after death to occur
I m a physicist at heart
The matrix is possible god is possible
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I have this debate often with my roommate
Many have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him
Am I missing something Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate More importantly who is real competition for him EDIT From todays conversations I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25 popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans and as a more mainstream candidate arises the split votes wont go to him that is the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary given any other more mainstream republican candidate
But a career politician vs Trump both speaking in vagaries I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently
If he sticks to a policy that is antithetical to a group then another would be preferred by that group
This is because Americans don t actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction
The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes and he is wealthy but appears genuine achieving a halo effect After realizing this I asked several other people and realized that basically my friends like Clinton don t like how he communicates but then have no major disagreement with the content
A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn t understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls
Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or and the majority but this is difficult to define and ignores the perception
One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate s policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist and while I can agree that it is a fine definition the person then asserts that this is not trump and I disagree as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor self interested leadership a corrupt political culture and compromised ideas and strategies and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
For the same reason that this is the America we have I can t see how a candidate fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans isn t hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America
However I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate
Who wouldn t want more free health clinics in their neighborhood And if the total square footage needed for both abortion and healthcare services shouldn t change much so the long term increase in rental or real estate costs shouldn t be significant
Such a move would direct any criticism and protests to the new abortion only business and away from the health services businesses
Opening new free health clinics should be fairly easy from a local regulatory standpoint
Many are in buildings that could easily be divided for multiple tenants already so that s exactly what would be happening
But if that isn t true it would present additional challenges to any spinoff
Businesses spin off business lines all the time for any variety of reasons
They would no longer face threats of cuts to their federal funding
Then all the other health services that Planned Parenthood provides could be conducted free from the stigma of being provided by America s largest abortion provider
I wouldn t be surprised if they were actually able to increase their funding with such a move
I have no reason not to believe that
But I don t think that would be a HUGE obstacle
Since their abortion business line receives no taxpayer funds there shouldn t be any financial loss from spinning it off into a new business
The biggest challenge I can think of that would be faced would be the need for additional locations since all existing locations would have to be designated as either abortion services or health services locations
The only other caveat of this view is that I m taking Planned Parenthood s contention that no federal funds are used in the abortion business at face value
Many of the existing locations could likely be split into two separate but side by side facilities
Planned Parenthood is a non profit but it is still a business
I think it would more than offset by increased revenue from greater public support and reduced costs related to security and dealing with protests
Too many stories of kids finding their parents guns and getting hurt
In general I understand that having guns around increases homicide rates and suicides and all that but I don t think the answer is to ban guns altogether
If someone comes into your home with a gun being without a gun sounds terrifying
I do think that criminals will get guns either way
I believe that a lot of the increased homicides that come from increased gun availability come from improper gun education
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Sometimes it s the only thing stopping you from getting killed
In such situations the guns should have been put in a vault or something
and it shouldn t necessarily be purely predictable should it the player needs to progress and level up so they can meet their bigger challenges in the future
putting aside the discussion about other games mechanics and why in some cases it works much worse than others there s just better non annoying ways of doing that now
i don t think they have the need
at least that way if you have no items and are on your way back to somewhere because you re too injured you have a chance of maybe avoiding the enemy mobs
it doesn t happen every five steps
with an rpg game the logic seems simple enough i guess there s a turn based system of combat and there needs to be a way to trigger the combat screen from the overworld
it doesn t come out of nowhere
it still accomplishes the same purpose that random encounters do
invisible enemies starting a 5 second battle transition with a chance that you can t run especially if you re in over your head and trying to get out of an area with no ability to see it coming no warning no possibility of avoiding it is just bad
so random battles that just happen with no warning while you re walking just like warpy screen you re in a battle now stuff
especially when even something like the paper mario system exists
you take 4 steps after getting out of a battle and arrive in another one that the run functino won t work for and you start taking damage and then you can t escape again so you take more damage and that just starts a whole snowball of oh my god fuck this shit
if you collided with them you started a battle
the millionth time we saw a zubat in pokemon it
this really only applies to turn based games in fact i don t know of any real time games that have this system of enemy encounters
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
it wasn t really doing anything for us
off the top of my head paper mario on n64 had visible enemy mobs walking around
meanwhile the battles themselves are just often an unnecessary repetitive near useless way to grind
The fact of the matter is assault weapon as a term used in the gun control discussion is completely made up
They rely on the ignorance of their voting base when it comes to firearm functionality and homocide statistics
For a rifle to suddenly become an Assault Rifle all you need to do is add cosmetic additions that don t change the functionality of the weapon at all
Now let s look at what is actually killing people
And frankly nothing screams I don t know what I m talking about more than someone who keeps insisting that assault weapons are the problem
What is an Assault Weapon Don t Google it just try and answer it for yourself
I conclude that the polticians behind gun control laws don t actually care about reducing violence
Anyone who educates themselves for a few seconds on Google can see that Assault Weapon bans are entirely superficial and do nothing to curb violence which makes the Gun Control crowd look more ignorant as a whole
I ask people this question plain and simple all the time and they get completely screwed up
Alright so we ve established that the assault weapon term is silly
If you re like most anti gun types you have absolutely no idea what it actually means
As such they pass laws that don t actually ruffle the Gun Lobby s feathers too much because the cosmetic items don t really matter
Are you an individual who is against assault weapons If so here s a fun self awareness test
Everytime the topic of Gun Control comes up be it on the internet on the news or in person it seems to me that these this point dominates the conversation
As you can see handguns are OVERWHELMINGLY used more than rifles
Hell I wouldn t even be surprised if this is exactly what PRO gun lobbyists are pushing behind the scenes
Go ahead and take a shot at my view _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
That s what s terrorizing our country right Well take a look at this Mother Jones The weapons used are again OVERWHELMINGLY handguns So why is there is big outrage against AR 15s and other semiautomatic rifles again Now for my personal interpretation of this data
Rifles are used less than blunt objects But I know everyone gets worked up over mass shootings
They take more space require more maintenance and are ultimately dirtier as butts keep touching them
Squatting is more comfortable easier and healthier than sitting
it plays well with gravity so less pressure is needed and lowers the risk of cancer and other ailments
When washed properly the use of your hand is preferable to toilet paper It might sound disgusting but when you think about it using a thin piece of frail paper to smear around fecal matter with no water or soap is even worse
Toilet paper is messy expensive and damages the environment
Modern europen toilets are large bulky and complex

Gay relationships do not affect other relationships
Discrimination of gay relationships is founded in bigotry
Legally there should be no ill treatment of consenting adults wishing to engage in incestuous relationships 2
Love is grounds for a relationship regardless of sexual orientation 3
The only argument I see as vaguely valid is that children born from incestuous relationships have a greater chance of developing genetic deformities
Everyone seems to have an eww attitude to incest without giving any valid arguments why they re against it
Socially we should stop viewing incestuous relationships as taboo _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
However if the criteria for a relationship is the ability of a couple to conceive a healthy child then many people with genetic dispositions should not be able to have children either
I can use many apposite arguments for incest equally valid for gay relationships
And on top of that the US the backbone of ISAF is pulling out slowly
Hi r CMV I think the War in Afghanistan in the past decade was a failure
Once we pull out the ANA will not be able to hold up just as the Iraqi army has collapsed under ISIS s and other terrorist organizations pressure once the US left
The situation is similar to Vietnam
The Afghan population does not trust NATO soldiers enough and even if they do it s the minority
The Taliban insurgency is still present and increasing and the general order has been not restored
Please don t downvote everything I say just because you disagree please
If I get drunk and crash my car it s my problem
Here s my logic though If I get drunk and blow off all my money it s my problem
If I get drunk and get into a fight it s my problem
A drunk person can give consent if they consentually got drunk
Of course though if you slip something into my drink and have sex with me that s not my fault and if you give me a drink and say it s Mountain Dew when it is actually something that knocks me out it s your fault
worknman brought up something I didn t think to address but I meant if someone says yes and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision it s not rape
And if you were given it under a false idea of what you were ingesting it s arguably still rape
So also if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say no and are too drunk to fight back it s still rape because they didn t give consent
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I m probably gonna get lynched for asking this but it s basic courtesy
If I get drunk and have sex it s my problem
It s very obviously going to happen but please just don t
So if it wasn t concious and consentual then it s still rape
If this is a duplicate post I apologize an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed
None of which in this day an age negatively impact these people s outlook of life and how happily they could live their lives
More so the goal changes simply to be as happy as we can be
If a person chooses to live happily in a way that defies the necessities of survival that person ought to be respected nonetheless
A blue eyed person is abnormal but not lesser
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
But social variations that directly go against how we were designed to live are abnormalities
The easiest way to change modernism to allow all peoples to be happy is to change our view of how we perceive them in a similar way we do not hate people with retardations because in a point in time it was okay to allow those who cannot survive and procreate to die off
Therefore being homosexual is no longer a negative change simply an abnormality
In the same way I would call blue eyes and homosexuality an abnormality
Being transgender is a disagreement between mind and body
A transgender person is abnormal but not lesser
In early stages of human life a human that thought it was not human would have a very difficult time achieving it s specie s fundamental goals
A homosexual or transgender is a person with an abnormality that at a point in time would negatively impact their ability to survive and procreate but has no impact on their ability to be happy
But as I have said ability to survive is not something we restrict happiness to
If in a perfect world all humans primarily use right hands over left then a left handed person would be abnormal but still able to live just as easily as any right handed person
Also I would say if modernism has a way to remedy the abnormality to allow the abnormal being to still be happy then it ought to be remedied
In 2015 homosexuality is not a negative change because procreation is not a fundamental goal whereas happiness is
In early stages of human life homosexuality was a negative change from normality because it disallowed the life form to bare more life
Living in the world that we do our goal as a species is not to procreate as much as possible because we do not require it for survival of the species
I would ultimately call transgenderism an abnormality keeping in mind that normalcy is subject to change and is culture specific
A homosexual person is abnormal but not lesser
If a human who lived in our early stages as humans was 100 homosexual in a world mostly heterosexual a homosexual would have difficulty passing their genes along to future generations
In 2015 we no longer have these fundamental goals because instead being comfortable and happy is what we desire
If in this nonperfect world a life form s goal is ultimately to survive and procreate for future generations then something that inhibits this primal goal would be a negative change
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Third peruse buzzfeed examples of micro aggression and you ll find largely either overt racism or just plain ignorance in most cases
It s not uncommon for speakers lecturers teachers etc to assume their audience is ignorant on a subject in order to explain it in terms most can understand
He even accused 7 Eleven of racism for selling watermelon flavored Slurpees
Yet if the person making the statement has no ill will or purposeful denigration in mind it is not actually aggressive
The man she is talking about is the guy that shot the reporter and her cameraman
Third the examples I ve seen are largely straight forward racism or examples of ignorance but should not be used to support the idea that micro aggression is prevalent in society
So what we have is a person who perceived a comment as offensive and who gets to justify his own negative reaction by inferring some ill intent or subconscious denigration on the speaker with no attempt to ascertain how the speaker felt or what he she meant or why the conversation went the way it did
Yet noted in article and by the NY Post gt Williams took nearly everything as a racial insult
But that does not make the speaker a micro aggressor nor does it make the phrase in question micro aggressive
The listener feels hurt so she he feels attacked hence she he calls the words or person that hurt her him aggressive
Either way the examples are either not micro nor or not aggressive
If a person legitimately doesn t understand that a person from Japan speaks Japanese then call them ignorant not micro aggressors
Similarly because it is subjective it is left up to the listener to determine whether or not the phrase caused harm
There also isn t any attempt to understand the context in which a phrase was used
Let s take another real world example
When a manager brought in watermelon for employees Williams reportedly said You re doing that because of me You guys are calling me out because I m black
Second there are scant scientific studies confirming the supposed detrimental effects of micro aggression
CMV on any or all of the above
This man was not a racist by any stretch of the imagination but he was spontaneously assuming that a black linguist must only be interested in societal issues rather than the wonky mechanics of grammar
So why the support And the fact that the term does not consider the intent of the speaker means that we have to infer some form of denigration has taken place merely so long as the listener is subjectively harmed
Finally I believe acceptance of micro aggressions as I ve described is actually detrimental to us as a society
And if they say you smell like rice maybe they re just racist
Assuming those examples are true Williams was taking innocuous comments and inferring negative intent without taking any time to understand the situation or the speaker
I ll be at my computer in a bit and I ll fix what I can
The first is that the term suggests we are dealing with small forms of aggression when in fact it s often subconscious and it doesn t have to actually be aggressive so long as the person perceiving it feels harmed
I have three main contentions with micro aggressions as I understand them
First the term itself is a sensationalized misnomer
And micro aggression is a theory that does and expects us to validate or justify even false sense of victimization
Yet from the same Wikipedia article I linked above Derald Wing Sue a proponent of the term acknowledges that gt the people perpetrating microaggressions often intend no offense and are unaware they are causing harm This raises two interesting points
It is merely an attempt for the hurt individual to validate his or her feelings of being attacked without actually understanding the speaker
It could not only lead to demonizing otherwise innocuous statements and their speakers but it could lead to a false sense of victimization or victim playing
Aggression is defined by a simple Google search as gt hostile or violent behavior or attitudes toward another readiness to attack or confront
This is dangerous because it does not leave any room for reasonable minds to differ on the interpretation of a phrase because the affect on the listener is what is paramount
Now granted there may be more to this story than the author revealed but I can t add elements to his story where there are none
She feels his sense of victimization is justified
The problem was that he spontaneously assumed I wasn t familiar with the basic grammatical topic he was covering when I as familiar with it as any linguist of 25 years standing was interested in a more specific matter
I would say micro aggressions are more likely cases of macro sensitivities but that s an aside
The use of the term is merely meant to shame the speaker or cast derision
Ps I ve started this thread on my phone so formatting may blow
First as I m using it from Wikipedia is gt the casual degradation of any socially marginalized group such as poor people disabled people and sexual minorities Accepting this definition it seems that the term is a misnomer as there does not have to be any form of aggression whatsoever
From article it appears that gt Sally Kohn of CNN tweeted that Williams was mentally unstable AND appears to have acted out of sense of victimization i have no reason to believe not justified
As I ve described above the term micro aggression relies too much on the listener and his her perceived harm
Now Williams was likely deranged or mentally ill given his reactions and I don t expect every person who uses the phrase micro aggression to go on a shooting spree when their feelings get hurt but I have to wonder how many people moved by this micro aggression movement fed Williams anger or told him his feelings were legitimate or gave his anger validation instead of just suggesting a sit down to help the listener understand the message
The author gives us no explanation as to how he knows the speaker spontaneously assumed I wasn t familiar with the basic grammatical topic he was covering or was spontaneously assuming that a black linguist must only be interested in societal issues rather than the wonky mechanics of grammar
Trevor Fair a cameraman at WDBJ said Parker would say The reporter s out in the field and Williams would respond What are you saying cotton fields That s racist
Given the subjective nature of the harm there has been little or no scientific studies that can accurately assess the supposed prevalence or detriment of these micro aggressions on society
Perhaps the speaker knew it was a complex subject and was trying to break it down in layman s terms
The use of the term aggression actually highlights the problem with the phrase micro aggression and that is that it relies too much on the subjective sensitivities of the listener
gt forceful and sometimes overly assertive pursuit of one s aims and interests Or gt the action of attacking without provocation especially in beginning a quarrel or war
Take this in which the author describes his encounter with micro aggression gt I once asked a linguist a question about their presentation only for him to repeatedly give me an answer I wasn t seeking
I guess I just don t get how this movement can care so much about the subjective listener and give so little consideration to the speaker Could any meaningful movement be so one sided And is that a movement that is sustainable or even worthy of pursuing I d say no
Fourth use of the term may be more detrimental than helpful

We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I am not religious to be honest but I just don t really think that my life needs sex or companionship to be 1 2 decent
When I told a couple of people that I know they were shocked and wanted me to get some therapy or some other waste of time but its nothing to do with homophobia I just don t get along with other people don t like people being close to me and I don t get lonely so I see it as a rational choice I am perfectly happy in my small flat with my pet dog and that s it
People seldom shift on these big issues because views aren t evidence based they re ideological
These are largely unrelated topics yet at least 80 of the time people hold these suites of ideas
There has been little data to change peoples minds we ve just had a kind of cultural shift and now its broadly accepted
An overall change in societal norms on the issue
If people did have beliefs based on evidence there d be a greater diversity in the beliefs individuals held
As it is if I know a person cares about climate change odds are they are anti gun rights and pro choice
The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons
If they re big on border protection they re gonna be small government and pro gun rights
Same sex marriage is a good example of this
This wasn t even on the agenda 20 years ago
It wasn t data or evidence that changed people s minds it was a change in societies norms
I ve known people to retire or have a health crisis which shakes up their whole outlook including views on the big issues
The other thing which I believe can change folks minds is personal experience change
Sure they ll have a few go to facts or stats that are essentially cherry picked to support their view or they may even be aware of the news etc but new evidence rarely changes people s minds
Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue My son came out now I m pro same sex marriage So persuade me people are actually rational and can be convinced by actual facts CMV To clarify I mean objective evidence as opposed to emotive appeal
When I see debate about the big issues people don t seem to particularly care about evidence
If they shift on these issues its for emotional reasons
This forgets the fact that according to the same source students can attend an in state university for just shy of 10 000 for a far more affordable of 40k

Assuming the worst case and a student pays full sticker price that s around 125k in debt
Even for students who support themselves these options make the 125k number far less
The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge sums of debt is a function of their own suboptimal decisions

It s best to acknowledge that and try to understand why liberals are angry rather than denying that they should be
Denial Anger In my experience conservatives seem to deny the problem while liberals tend to become angry about it
This is all very comforting for the denial crowd
This silent entrenched sexism is the scariest of all and it will take a huge cultural shift in order to fix it
Stick to the facts don t exaggerate and you ll find that you have a lot more allies than enemies
Angry exaggerating liberal groups often say Women get 78 cents on the dollar for equal work but the fact this this number was not calculated by controlling for equal work
Sexism is deeply ingrained in today s culture in America and it s almost impossible to step away from it
But she didn t because she was raised believing that science was for boys
But the truth is even if no individual actors are behaving in an evil or misogynistic fashion the gap itself is reflective of something very negative about our society
Takeaway for liberals Sure there are some goons at the top of the financial totem pole pulling some fucked up Mad Men bullshit on their female employees they should be arrested
But it happened anyway because the sexism is so deeply rooted in all of us that we don t always realize when it s affecting our decision making
For them this means we don t live in such an evil sexist society after all it s just that women make different choices than men study different topics and prefer a less salary focused work life balance
Angry people exaggerate and might attack or alienate would be allies
However in addition to being comforted the denial crowd also gets a little bit angry hearing all this Why are the liberals still yelling Why are they lying claiming that the 78 statistic controlled for everything I thought this was solved guys why am I a misogynist for recognizing that stat is being taken out of context it s just an AVERAGE And this next part should make the conservative reader feel a bit less at ease But the fact is the vast majority of academics believe that workplace bias and sexism do play at least some role causing the gender pay gap
This next part is where a liberal reader might get upset
Exaggerations are easier to deny than facts and if you want the denial crowd to come around you can t give them easy targets of deniable rhetoric
The wage gap in the US is currently close to 78 meaning for every dollar that the average man made in 2014 the average woman made 78 cents
All of these subtle pressures and more contribute the the 78 gap
The wage gap where the 78 statistic comes from is an average
Takeaway for conservatives We all know it would be nice if there was no pay gap or if we could explain away the gap as somehow fair
I ll focus on just the pay gap in the United States but it s worth noting
However anger can also be damaging to the movement
This still does not compare based completely equal work though only on age education experience marital status number of children race and religion and the study concludes that more of the gap could still be explained by missing variables
Both male and female professors offered on average 4000 more for the male candidate
A study was done where professors were given identical resumes the only difference was the name at the top was changed between John and Jennifer
Instead male engineers and CEOs were compared with equal weight to female social workers and maids
The wage gap as defined by this piece is the average difference between male and female earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings
Women are taught to look pretty and become a mother
In the case of this study it is reasonable to assume that the employers were not intentionally giving John more money because he was male
So the whole world is missing out
But by making it sound like this is the norm at your average company is going to turn off a lot of skeptics
If someone takes a dump on my desk the size of the dump is not the issue
In fact according to the U
Anger in my opinion actually does some good
What I believe happened is the professors tried their best to honestly assess what each candidate was worth without ever consciously acknowledging that gender played a role in their calculation
The Gender Wage gap is a topic of contention in the US many conservatives denounce the gap as a myth while liberals tend to speak out against the gap placing blame primarily on workplace discrimination especially by the men making hiring decisions for these companies
Department of Labor when you do attempt to control for equal work the pay gap shrinks to
So when a fact this upsetting comes to you there are two very human responses
A person should not be more likely to live in poverty just because she was born a woman
So lets say the gap really is only caused by women making different choices Why do they make different choices Boys are taught from a very young age that they should make loads of money and become an engineer or a CEO
It s in our movies our TV even our actual lives where fathers tend to be the primary breadwinners of the family while mothers cook dinner and change diapers
It s very possible that there have been a handful of female Einsteins over time that if given the opportunity could have invented a cure for cancer a solution to the world s energy crisis
I m not going to say well how big of a dump is it Oh that s almost like you didn t take on my desk at all

Angry people spread awareness hold rallies write blog posts etc
If you are an egalitarian or if you have a sense of justice and forget everything else about this issue whether you re liberal or conservative this should trouble you
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
But the most troubling thing that conservatives should be aware of is that even if sexism played 0 role in directly causing the gender pay gap the bigger issue is the role that sexism plays INDIRECTLY to create the gender pay gap
And it s not just men guilty of it it s women too
3 human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases but at what cost It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another it s like they don t even want their species to survive
I get they aren t actually making this choice this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need
Hell half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn t produce enough milk
That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday
Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular not because they have a good chance of survival
First off I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting however I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming
Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird
Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference
While this is regrettable it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon
With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder
I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention
Here are the reasons I believe this 1 Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China
2 pandas as a species have chosen poorly
If they cannot achieve this goal I don t think it s worth the resources to help them grow
We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them
This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won t have anywhere to live
4 I m not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda
Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species
They are carnivorous animals who s main diet is bamboo
Their digestion can only process about 5 of the stuff in bamboo
The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain
Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper rationality
New humans means more consumers of the Earth s resources and more producers of waste
This seems to play out on the societal level
I will use one clear example for the sake of focus while knowing that there are other examples of this as well
I present these arguments not because they uniquely matter but because they seem valid
Yet despite this obvious teology of humans the rational arguments are given preference
I will talk about producing off spring
In conclusion this is but one of many examples where hyper rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct
com interactive pf cost of children 3
Firstly that having children will detrimentally affect the environment
We observe this in every known creature we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure we observe people s special fondness to babies
gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Hyper rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means rather than a mixture of reason emotion tradition religion evolutionary instinct etc
Secondly the cost of having children can be astronomical
However in the pursuit of being rational these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life namely that animals produce off spring to survive
Education levels and industrialization correlate with lower birth rates
They are shall we say for the sake of argument true
In my experience people against procreating articulate 3 4 arguments against having children
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Thirdly you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child
com 2009 08 07 having children brings high carbon impact 2
But what am I willing to pay for a roof over my head Heat in my apartment Food on my table Even if the price far exceeds what they cost to produce I can t just decide to not pay for these things so without limitations on what can be charged what s to stop prices from going up indefinitely Last but not least does raising the minimum wage perhaps discourage skilled labor If you re a person who s worked hard or went into student loan debt in order to attain a 15 hr job isn t this the rawest deal possible for you Suddenly everyone is making the same as you minus your debt payments having done none of the hard work you did Suddenly you went from middle class to the worst off of anyone all because you worked hard got skills in order to get a better job
And how fucked would you be if your current standard of living is based on making 16 hr and suddenly rent prices raised like this
So what am I missing here Would greatly value input of anyone with education experience in economics since honestly the reason I m asking this question is because I have very little knowledge in the area
If instead we set regulations on necessary commodities as a percentage of the wage of a minimum wage worker wouldn t that make more sense Free market works great for things people want but not so well for things people need
Let s say we raise the minimum wage to 15 hr
Hooray poverty is solved But wait
TL DR I think raising the minimum wage would simply result in the cost of living raising to match leaving minimum wage workers no better off and middle class folks worse off Change my view Educate me
For example if the price of an Xbox exceeds what I think it s worth I can simply live without one demand will go down if they re priced too high eventually the price will stabilize
What s to stop landlords from calculating exactly how much extra everyone can pay now Wouldn t the new cheapest place to rent be the maximum that a 15 hr wage could afford I think people saying there would be less jobs is just fear mongering but I would argue people making minimum wage would be no better off than they were before due to inflated costs of living if there are no limitations on those who set prices
They tend to be strong supporters of free markets strong gun rights low taxes minimal government regulation less foreign intervention and neither force nor fraud as their conception of criminal law
policy closer to libertarian ideals that president can be said to be closer to ideal
Rand Paul has diverged significantly away from pure libertarian ideology in order to increase his popularity among Republicans
In short my view is that since libertarianism can be boiled down to a few simple axioms and it seems to be the case that libertarians want a context free application of these axioms a computer would be a far superior leader to implement libertarianism than a fallible emotional human being
We can imagine during times of emergency he or she may be tempted to take actions that do not conform strictly to libertarianism
For this CMV we ignore the question of electability
His father has remained more ideologically pure but he opposes abortion which could be considered a freedom attacking position
So even if the economy has tanked half the population is unemployed and starving and a foreign power s army has landed on our shores so long as the president has brought U
First I am not a libertarian but I used to browse which had a large libertarian contingent so I would read libertarian arguments frequently
Ideal Here ideal does not refer to a president who oversees economic growth decreased unemployment global peace etc
Beyond these two let s consider a hypothetical human politician who espouses views even more libertarian than Ron Paul
Let s look at the two best known libertarian politicians in the United States Ron Paul and his son Rand Paul
President I specifically refer to the President of the United States but I d imagine this could extend to heads of government chief executives of other countries or even governors of states within the United States
Instead here ideal refers to conformance to libertarian ideology
My view is that a computer would make for the ideal libertarian president

Many libertarians however at least those on Slashdot want to limit immigration in other words they may be comfortable limiting these freedoms to U

Since guns take more lives than they save To claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God
Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated
Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable
I d rather get people educated and out of poverty
I invite you to Change My View
To be clear I could give a about gun rights I don t see any logical derivation of those rights from nature
There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists
At the same time people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me because there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free
if you can t convince me of this you are probably not really going to convince anyone
So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all
Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent my question to you is how does it come about that this right is inherent What makes this right inherent There is a difference between rights granted by law and natural rights
I tell you this so you can understand I m an open mind on this issue and if you can t convince me you probably won t convince anyone
Show the logical derivation from nature which I believe you are claiming exists
currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe harmonious and productive society and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end
Tell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights
I see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms
focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide and sow fear rather than to unify and bring progress
I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate
org wiki Natural_and_legal_rights Explain why we have the natural right to self defense and how logically that right extends to include firearm ownership
But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment
I actually think guns are the least of our problems and I m not really a gun grabber because there are a couple dozen things I d rather do first
I am currently against both gun grabbers and gun rights
my question is how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature It just does is not a sufficient answer
But laws can t give or take away inherent natural rights
So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject
If Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world just as physical law derives from the nature of space time and matter
Ladies do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply Your fault
If makeup didn t work there wouldn t be a multi billion dollar industry surrounding it
Do you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom s basement and wears black velcro shoes Your fault
If you re a 4 10 male it s not your fault you just have shitty height genetics
Men do you not shave your unibrow nose hair Your fault
Do you have acne Take better care of your skin
If you have a nose that is 2 1 2 inches long and crushed in eye socket then yes you have an out
There are some miracle acne drugs out there
However if you are not disfigured and your facial syemetry is average and you are still considered unattractive well then it s your fault
Do you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History Your fault
Again this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over
Are you balding Depending on the structure of your skull this is debatable but you can take steps to mitigate this that don t involve a comb over

In both cases you cannot change those issues
Also I am not saying being attractive is easy
Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion Your fault
Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can t afford decent clothes Work harder go back to school still your fault
Finally this post isn t supposed to make anyone feel good
Everyone can be a 7 10 out of ten
Do you smell like ass because you don t take a shower every day use deodorant and wear cologne perfume Your fault
The only times where it s not your fault is if you are disfigured or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry
Do you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their comfortable Your fault
Spare me the hateful pm s
I am fully aware of how douchy it sounds
Nearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault
I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10 10 but if you are a 2 10 I firmly believe you can go to a 7 10

This CMV was about a specific concern I had about the candidate
Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships thus being good at making friends
It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak but he clearly wasn t in control of the situation
Sorry my post looks too organized I guess that s a personality thing
He has very little track record of doing this

I agree with most of Bernie s domestic politics but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don t think he has what it takes
2 It requires building alliance and persuading people
And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally he just passively let it happen seemed a bit bewildered
Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US 3 A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone s goals
Chuck Schumer who also participated in the VA talks
Bernie is an independent does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades
He can be quite assertive in a non blustery way http youtu
Edit Thanks for all of the info I haven t 100 changed my mind but I was clearly wrong about a number of things as the links you provided show He is willing to use force and can be quite serious and calculating in describing his military policy http abcnews

It doesn t help us grow at all
There are other sources of information that help us grow much better
If that is so what is the point of fiction apart from a source of entertainment that may or may not help us in the long run If all it does is provide short term joy what is the point of it Is our time not better spent trying to grow ourselves Why waste our time trying to entertain ourselves when we could just use other forms of relaxation between sessions of growing ourselves Is that not the goal of life To improve and advance our lives and those of others Or am I wrong Is fiction truly of some use Or if it isn t of any use then should we still consume it If so why Why not simply just exercise meditate or sleep instead of reading fiction What makes fiction a better alternative to those activities
To change my view you d need to tackle some of the points probably point 1 but maybe some combination of other points would do it too
I did study some economics and read something about the subject and these arguments just aren t persuasive
But this assumption seems to not work outside of recessions
Some arguments on CMV rested on the consumption multiplier assumption
Minimum wage raises costs of companies that happen to offer jobs to low qualified people and does not raise the costs of companies who do not offer jobs to these people at all
It is badly targeted social policy
Reasons behind the points above 1 Unless long term demand curve for unqualified labour is vertical minimum wage causes unemployment
Why do I hold the view 1 Minimum wage causes unemployment of low qualified minority hated people often resulting in long term unemployment
3 In the USA a study was done and found out that the overwhelming majority of people earning minimum wage do not come from poor families
Could be different in different countries though
This makes such sector less profitable and some companies will close shop exactly those companies that specialize in providing jobs to the unqualified people
I am open to change my view but it seems to me that the case against minimum wage is extremely strong so I hope to see extremely strong arguments for minimum wage
There is a question if raising minimum wage causes less inequality
4 Minimum wage is at best zero sum game between employer and employee
There is a social function in minimum wage it s weird to ask randomly chosen companies to perform it these functions should be born be the whole society not by the companies that just happened to offer to these people the best deal
The fact is there is lots of research that does find the effect and the consensus is not that there is no effect
Diverting money from investment into consumption doesn t seem to be such an obviously great idea as these arguments seem to suggest after all it s investment that is the key to more production
Less unemployment means less production and more social transfers which means lower GDP 2 Minimum wage is forcing some employers to do charity
Empirical research most employers and employees alike tend to ignore the law if they can make it
Also quite a lot of the effect can be long term while most research is short term
Regardless of the answer I find it quite unethical to say in a group of 10 poor people I ll sentence 1 of you to long term unemployment so that the other 9 could get a raise
4 Minimum wage at best moves money from one pocket to another
3 Most people who would allegedly get a raise thanks to minimum wage don t need it
There are lot s of CMV s about minimum wage where the authors are persuaded by reasons that seem to me wrong
The argument that companies have lots of profits therefore minimum wage will not cause them to lay off people is wrong employment is based on marginal product not on do I have money to employ the person companies can borrow money to pay the wage if would be profitable
What makes low qualified labour market with many people on both demand supply sides so special that all over the world at all times you d expect the demand curve to be vertical This is quite an extraordinary position and I haven t seen anything that would be a reasonable justification for it
Therefore I d expect empirical research not to find an effect even if the unemployment effect is quite large
You can t repeal laws of economics by wishful thinking
There are many ways to skin a cat companies can base the manufacturing on low tech high people intensive process or the other way round
It is waste of money trying to help people in such way
There is no reason to think the long term demand curve in a such general market is vertical
Raising costs motivates people to do less of it which means the companies will be motivated not to offer low marginal productivity jobs and adjust their processes accordingly

Why should I spend X amount of money to subscribe to Y publication if I m not seeing the return on investment when I can subvert their subscription methods and read their articles anyways
With the advent of the internet most of these publications have moved towards a subscription based model in order to read unlimited articles within their databases
I ve learned that most of these publications actually allow you to avoid their paywalls with a simple google search of their headline
The counter argument of my subscription fee being used to cover the expenses salaries and overheads of the underlying institutions does not really take any hold with me as we are talking about the giants of the industries and the profits they make I m sure are doing them extremely well these days
I ve contemplated a lot lately whether or not to subscribe to some of the news outlets that I enjoy reading
What I ve found however is that the subscription fees they are charging on a monthly basis does not coincide with the amount of relevant information I m gaining
However the karma system is a full democracy and if people want to see that sort of thing then they upvote it

They say that this is trash or filler content and that it should not be on Reddit
I don t believe these are the fundamental causes of the inadequacies or faults of our government
If the government is doing something you think is wrong like intervening in Israel increasing social spending subsidizing fossil fuels or pushing for universal healthcare or conducting widespread surveillance it s probably because there are significant parts of the country that truly believes it s the right thing to do not because your government is stupid corrupt
I often see people complain extensively about the faults of our electoral system or the party politics that result in crippling gridlock or how corrupted officials end up being above the law
That may be true but party politics is ultimately an emergent property of a politically divided people
People might say it s due to party politics
That s why they say an electorate typically likes their specifically elected official but dislikes the government overall
And to make matters worse people fail to recognize this because they normally participate in communities that are like minded
So there we go I don t think the problem with our government is that it may be corrupt inefficient inept or disproportionately controlled by corporations
I think the problem is that everyone thinks that everyone else is wrong
Because the totality of government will always theoretically include politically disagreeable elements
Political gridlock occurs because one half of the country wants things one way and the other half wants it the other way
I believe the ultimate reason why Americans see their government as corrupt inept and ignorant is because the United States is a country of deep political divisions
gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
And the discrepancy between their political beliefs and the failure of the government to represent those beliefs is erroneously chalked up to corruption incompetence or the influence of corporations
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
People end up caught in a political circlejerk where the perceived correctness of their political beliefs are artificially reinforced and perceived to be representative of the beliefs of the American People
However there s something that seems wrong with the above
4 of the property ownership also transfers per month
Not every person has the financial backing to obtain a long term mortgage
It might not stop slum lords from forcing tenants to sell back their
While both persons paid the same amount after 20 years person A could sell his property and have 240 000 returned
However there s something I like about the idea that if you let others use your property you agree to give up a portion of that property as well as part of that exchange
If a person had a 2 year lease they d own almost 10 of the property
Two cases Person A buys a property to live and every month for 20 years pays 1000
Basically rent morphs into a mortgage
I understand the importance of rent
Person B rents a property to live and every month for 20 years pays 1000
Had a thought about the disparity between mortgages and rent
Of course property owners are not required to rent their property
While not a perfect solution there s something that seems interesting that paying rent includes the requirement that
4 ever month or other under the table dealings though laws can be set up to protect against such practices
During lease renewal maybe the owner will want to buy that 10 back or the person moves and sells it to a higher bidder
People of means can buy property and essentially have others pay the mortgage for them
Of course the rent would be based in large part on the perceived value of the property and then also include costs that cover services

They unfailingly support expanding the military budget even though it is
Human Rights Except for the admirable dissent of John McCain the Republican Party is the party of torture
Also by GOP I mean elected officials and Party power structure not voters

Everyone always talks about quantitative easing and tax cuts but there s another means of job creation that doesn t get nearly enough attention littering
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I mean it s all well and good to toss a cigarette out your car window but what about putting your empty egg cartons back on supermarket shelves thus forcing the supermarket to hire specialists to sniff out the ersatz cartons and dispose of them Thus not only would a nationwide littering project improve the economy it would also provide an outlet for millions of repressed individuals to unleash their hidden creativity
If a state has 18 million people with only 10 million eligible to vote
This is also why the drinking age has not been lowered
While representatives claim to be serving all people in their district they really only care about those who can vote
To change my view you must provide clear examples of politicians listening to those who cannot vote and really taking their ideas into consideration
This is why no politicians care about prisons or orphans
Than that state s house seats should only reflect the 10 million people rather than the 18 million people
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Politicians do not care about those under 18 and those over 18 will soon be able to drink legally and thus once they turn 21 do not care about lowering the drinking age
The only reason why politicians care about public schools is because the parents of public school children can vote
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Until politicians start listening to those who cannot vote they should not be awarded seats which include those members of the population who cannot vote
The only real costs I d imagine is the slight expansion of alternative education possibilities and possibly having to keep students somewhere when school are closed
Instead they will be picked up in the term that they are covering advanced algebra and in all likelihood they will be moved to an alternative education institute
Two months is far too long for students to have a vacation and in all likelihood contributes to a loss of knowledge and habits associated with it
I hope this idea hasn t already been discussed to death and if it has could you provide links
My solution is scrapping the idea of a school year and really committing to the idea of terms
Students will have something like 2 3 weeks vacation between terms instead
We hold them back on a term basis
These institutions would focus on teaching the student in a receptive way a way that cannot be done in a general education system so that they can have a good foundation
The second advantage would be removing the large holiday breaks that many countries currently have
This way teachers can get paid the same and taxpayers pay the same
Instead let s restructure vacations around the terms
The key is that we either retain the same number of school hours or have less but make more efficient usage of each hour
Ok so I was thinking about the current education system mostly North American but I think it might be generalizable for the rest of the world
So I was thinking of a reform program that wouldn t cost either party
I look forward to your responses
Currently most forms of significant reform end up pissing off one of two parties teachers or the taxpayers government
And by getting rid of the year we can instead have students attend classes either 4 days a week or every day but only in the morning
The second aspect is that we can actually address student s comprehension of the material
All the other problems are being temporarily tabled if we adopt this reform
This is my idea of reform that would be somewhat practicable and would be the first real step in reform
Hopefully this would result in these students having a strong enough foundation to learn in a general education system
Which means we are already on a trimester situation and that we aren t so obsessed with standardized testing and our population is composed roughly of 80 urban dwellers
EDIT I am Canadian so I m coming from that POV
No longer will students be passed or failed on an annual schedule rather we ll deal with the advancement of students every couple months
It also means that we advance students based on proficiency not the arbitrary system of age
This might mean a student is who struggling in mathematics doesn t get passed even if they have a poor understanding of advanced algebra only to struggle with calculus in the next year
If we see a student perform poorly in a subject we have three break points to catch them
It allows their curriculum to be far more malleable and open to change
This would also require a reconception of alternative education institutions no longer would they be long term stays but likely to last only a term or two
This time would also allow teachers to better tailor the curriculum for a term instead of an entire year
The first is that we no longer have to waste time holding students back an entire year if they ve just done poorly in a few subjects
It does not matter if those prejudices are aimed at another minority group or even the majority group nor do the power dynamics involved or historical oppression play a part in determining what is racist behaviour
The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone else worse because of their race or ethnicity

Similarly past oppression can t be used as justification for present day racism

Furthermore a whole Any state with more than nine representatives could lose seats if it abridges all of these people s right to vote
For instance a District Court struck down a Texas voter ID law in October 2014 because it found that 600 000 people were prevented from voting
This could be especially useful for the DOJ after
The 19th and 26th Amendments imply that the restrictions to men at least 21 are changed to citizens at least 18
Some states would have probably already have lost a representative
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Section 2 of the 14th Amendment states gt Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers counting the whole number of persons in each state excluding Indians not taxed
The other question is if this policy would actually do anything and there are promising signs that it could
Just this year another voter ID law was struck down in Texas
This section which the 14th Amendment s biggest proponent Thaddeus Stevens called the most important in the article means that if a state denies 10 of their citizens the right to vote 10 of their seats in the House of Representatives should be taken away
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Therefore Congress could delegate this section as a voting law review mechanism for the Department of Justice to use
The Department could conduct regular reviews of state voting laws to determine how many people they prevent from voting
This time the Court found that
But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States Representatives in Congress the executive and judicial officers of a state or the members of the legislature thereof is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state being twenty one years of age and citizens of the United States or in any way abridged except for participation in rebellion or other crime the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty one years of age in such state

They re a person but they can only make certain decisions
an American white nationalist has proposed creating all white towns to which he refers to as Pioneer Little Europe
I think it is a good idea because it could potentially help minorities in the rest of the country
At one point he was trying to turn Leith North Dakota into such a town but is now focused on Antler North Dakota
Because of this there would be fewer racists in the rest of the country and minorities would therefore be less likely to experience racism or discrimination
I think his proposal is a good idea but not because I am a racist or white nationalist
If one or more all white towns were formed some of the racists throughout the country would move to these PLEs
I want to preface this I do not hate black people it is out of concern that I have read and researched this phenomena

No country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves

I ve seen it in my public school my college my street my city and in my intimate relations
I ve had loads of personal experiences in Black America that support my view
Millions of black people are exploited robbed and killed because of the corruption of civil society and whats worse is that people of African descent have come to accept this as being true

This causes the conversation to shift focus from the issues that are being brought forth by those minorities to a conversation involving race baiting and reverse racism

Work with animals in this way can be very forgiving and is often very rewarding
Raising the minimum wage would increase my payroll by 20 and I m not thrilled with that idea
For this new minimum wage I can get experienced assistants and certified techs
If my bare minimum is 15 hour then suddenly it makes sense to ignore the high school dropouts and part timers and inexperienced folks
Hiring these people is okay with me because the jobs like cleaning cages and walking dogs and mucking stalls are very simple and require very minimal training
Some of my employees don t make much but they aren t asked to do very much and their hours are often very flexible
I ll pass them over for somebody who can do the job for real
Currently the average staffer makes about 12 per hour
I find most people in my employ seem to like the work

I put in the most work I bear the greatest burden take on the most risk am financially responsible for a dozen other people and for all that I get to make the most money
Why wouldn t people like me just start ignoring the folks who made the old minimum wage and instead go for more qualified people who want the job at this higher minimum wage And before anybody tells me what a bad person I am for making money and not caring that people make less than I do please remember I went to school for a decade and incurred a mountain of debt and I bear all responsibility for what happens in my hospital
For at least 75K a year in additional costs I can do better than what I ve got
Why not Because the people I hire are often inexperienced uneducated and or have some restrictions on working
If I have to pay 15 hour well I can probably get better people for that much
Why should I pay so much to others This doesn t help people who have a hard time getting a job it hurts them

Further more even if USD value drops as a consequence of US printing more cash to pay back debts all other countries will follow to de value their currencies to compete with US just like we have seen in the past few years
No matter how much US government sets its defence budget US s armed force is built to be an offence force
21 in the world behind Saudi Arabia Israel and Russia this is not that much
However for what US public and government want it to be I think the current spending is well justified if not insufficient
We wouldn t get internet GPS jumble jets and spacecraft if US haven t thrown so much money into military
Spending more money developing and ensuring US s technological advantage on military means less casualties from those inevitable wars
Spending less on military dose not bring US better infrastructure education research
Military technologies benefits civilian life in the long run
Comparing to those countries and the collapsed USSR US is in a much better financial state
I fundamentally disagree the argument that we are not spending enough on such such such because we spend too much on military The fact is the amount we spend on military and other programs is not a zero sum game
Considering how the military complex works and US politician public thinks US will never stop bombing invading smaller countries to defend its freedom
US spending more on defence means we will spend less this will benefit our economy and allow us to put more money into our welfare system
US is already spending too much on military it s by far the most powerful force in the world why more In per GDP sense US ranked No
As a Canadian I know we don t have to worry about fighting off an invasion alone
US spending more on military doesn t necessary mean a safer world but at least it will make its NATO allies safer
Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US this industry s survival critically depends on US s defence policies and government orders without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military millions of jobs will be lost
Also US government and public have set their military force to be the keeper of freedom world police ever since the end of WWII
Yes US is in some serious debt right now however USD is the most indestructible currency ever existed in human history with US s economy size gold reserve and military power at its back it is impossible for USD to collapse in the foreseeable future
Yes the current size of US military is too big for a defensive force
I want to see human land on Mars before I am 50 so come on US congress make it happen Edit To answer some of the most frequent questions Why not spend the money on infrastructure medical research education NASA Well when US was cutting military spending in the 90s the federal spending on education infrastructure NASA higher education research also went down
US can always borrow more money from its own citizen or foreign countries without worrying about crisis like Greece happen
If America really wants to stand for freedom and democracy we shouldn t be aiding a country that so blatantly opposes both
First off our country is deep in debt and I really don t think we are in a position to be sending billions of dollars in military aid anywhere
Second we ought not to be sending military aid to a country who just had an elected government overthrown by the military who is systematically imprisoning and executing those who oppose them including 3 journalists who were sentenced to 3 years in prison for aiding terrorists

gt We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness In the Declaration of Independence it is made clear that the rights of men were not things to be granted by the government but things to be protected by the government by virtue of being fundamental to the nature of man
Edit Perhaps my view can be summed up this way The founders say natural human rights come from God The founders say the legitimacy of government is derived in part from respect of these rights The phrase Under God is a nice way of recognizing the natural rights of all people as seen by the founders People should act as if all people have rights from God regardless of whether they believe that is true A lot of the discussion here has devolved to theological debates about moral realism and the nature of God and clarifying that no God does not equal Christianity
It is not at it s core a religious claim but a moral and political claim about the relationship between a government and its citizens
Saying that the nation is Under God or that In God We Trust lays a foundation for proper bounds on government that would be absent if there weren t something under which even the government was

Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests Sure using violence or the threat of violence

That s great but it s all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job
Sure not every member of the military s job is to be a killer but those people are there to support the killers
The army doesn t just kill people they developed the Internet Yeah as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible
Again I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective
The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect
It s a sideshow a distraction
We don t keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief
Our military is so badass there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on
People were saying this was shameful and embarrassing to the US military a ridiculous simplification
I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate and until I went online the next morning I couldn t imagine anyone would disagree with him
Thus a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes
That s their real purpose simple as that
We keep them around to kill people and break things
Most people I ve seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this
That s why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns for the killing of people and the breaking of things
That said I think he was dead on
Well yeah but it s also absolutely true

But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave it would result in unfair hiring biases against women
Wouldn t a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse It s particularly unfair to women who aren t planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won t ever even need in the first place If paternity leave were also mandated then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely to take leave as well making the expected value of a man s labor to an employer the same as a woman s and hopefully eliminating the bias
Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are more focused on kids

So I don t really like this view that I hold and would love to have it changed
Assad ultimately triumphs ending the civil war and regaining his control over the country
Assad consolidating power would be worse than ongoing civil war and potentially an ultimate victory for ISIS
Other Islamist groups such as the al Nusra front are also gaining in power
Civil war continues and the country entirely falls apart
A fourth more desirable outcome seems unlikely to me at this point
The other more positive rebel groups have a real chance of winning with US material support and that if so they could establish a positive govermnent
But at this point I feel like the first option is the best and Assad ending the civil war by defeating ISIS would be a better outcome than continued civil war and the continued existence of ISIS and perhaps ISIS s ultimate victory
A better course of action would be for the US to directly intervene militarily against ISIS and Assad and establish a new government
They are highly fragmented are ill equipped militarily hold little territory and few resources and seem to have been superseded by other rebel groups including Islamists like the al Nusra Front
Assad is a bad bad man
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
They control much of the territory and most of the oil given them the economic power to sustain themselves in Syria as well as take and hold territory in Iraq thereby destabilizing that country
Even a victory by non ISIS rebels would likely lead to the insertion of other bad actors into power
There has been a civil war ongoing for years leading to massive destruction civilian deaths and refugees
It seems to me there are three likely outcomes 1
And of course they are wreaking incredible devastation on the local populations
The situation in Syria is an awful mess
There are also questions about just how good the FSA is as they have been coordinating with Islamists and also are accused of war crimes
ISIS triumphs either in that they continue to exist as a stable state or in that they take over Syria as a whole
He s not the kind of person the US would ideally like to support
Arguments that could change my view 1
Although other opposition groups still exist ISIS has risen to be the main opposition in Syria
It seems to be that women are vastly over represented when it comes to consumer spending and I believe that the burden of consumer spending must have a significant impact on their ability to earn a wage comparable to men

Shopping is not the salient contributing factor to the wage gap but appears to be a contributing factor https www
For certain things size does matter and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more
They can t see rated R movies
Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices
I know that thirteen is not universal but I find it wrong to charge adult prices for anyone under eighteen
Please leave the footnote below the following line but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post
A thirteen year old doesn t have much more money does a twelve year old
Kids pricing allows family s to be able to afford to go to things as a family
They re not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn t really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer
It seems like the only right they ve acquired is to technically see a PG 13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase
I think the problem I have is that most consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen
This doesn t make any sense
They don t even have the right to work for another few years
Thank you _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators

Adult tickets cost more than child s tickets for anything that distinguishes the two and often this makes sense
And specific to theaters adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly niche category of movies
Meanwhile white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution
When the Charleston shooting broke out my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser
While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US
There is a widely held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro Israel
The Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well
I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest
I realize this may come off as anti Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a self hating Jew although I think this only reinforces my point
Growing up Jewish in Canada I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination whether by the ancient Egyptians Greeks Romans Persians and more recently the Nazis
I ve even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date
My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah Passover Purim Yom Ha Shoah etc
Currently every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel even left wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada s frontrunner Tom Mulcair
Still extremist groups like the JDL attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations despite their classification as a terrorist group
UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel

This same concept can be seen elsewhere women for example
I think that in America there is a growing desire to be offended and that people tend to seek out areas in which they could be offended
There are so many things that can be directly attributed back to race or cultural upbringing but when this is pointed out it is called racist
This doesn t make sense to me and I think that it brings up issues that have little to no relevance and actually perpetuates their prevalence
I ve noticed that recently it seems like Americans tend to look for reasons to be offended
Again really not trying to sound offensive toward anyone with this post
That sentence is not trying to suggest that the race issue needs to be ignored merely that not as many people are actually racist as are being accused

Sure if you re in your 20 s or if you misrepresent who you are you might find some small portion of 13 year old girls who will have sexual conversations with you
I d like my view changed because I can t believe there are that many mind boggling stupid dudes out there that think that a 13 year old girl wants to have sex with them and when they go tot he 13 year old girl s house to have sex with her I think they are just going to verify their belief that they re being trolled and that no actual 13 year old girl exists I don t think they are going there actually expecting to have sex with a 13 year old girl
Rather it is intend as a general term indicating that the contrary is such a minuscule portion of the population that it is for all intents and purposes non existent
So when you get back from your chat with Chris Hansen change my view
Guys Come ON I mean I m sorry that I m yelling but seriously It is never a 13 year old girl
But if you accurately represent you 40 age and some 13 year old girl invites you over to her house to have sex with her IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A 13 YEAR OLD GIRL I don t know how to break this to you but there are no 13 year old girls who are interested in having sex with a 40 50 something dude
Towers are much weaker in Dota and smoke of deceit exists allowing for much more aggressive gameplay
Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement
LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based
Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron
Having played dota for 1 year and Lol for 6 months before that i have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets
Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play
Denying highground miss chance and pulling stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota
Dota heros are much more turbocharged any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends
Think techies vs teemo and heroes like tinker meepo lone druid invoker etc
Dota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement and that might lead people to LoL but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent
The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking

I don t think it s impossible that 911 was false flag but its a pretty big claim and I m yet to see good solid evidence
I watched 911 on tv as it was happening and it looked pretty real to me
I know the government have done a bunch of bad stuff Tuskegee Syphillis trials Iran Contra Watergate My Lai MK ultra etc

I cannot think of a single positive connotation associated with the word
You ve all probably heard it moist is the grossest word in the English language
It s a word you d use to describe something like a wart on a foot or a disgusting growth on a six month old container of yogurt
Comparatively moist is a walk in the park one quick flare of the mouth and you re done
However I d like to propose that moist is definitely not the worst word in the English language
The other argument I ll make here is that the mouth shape you make to say bulbous is way worse than that of moist
You might describe a delicious chocolate cake as moist for example
You have to twist it all sorts of disheartening ways closed to open to squished close again to open again to a gross final s sound
Moist has a lot of positive connotations
Think about it in terms of the ratio of possible positive uses of the word vs possible negative uses
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
There are plenty of words that are worse but I d like to focus on bulbous for the purpose of this CMV
It s pretty well documented we don t like the word
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
You might also use moisturizer if your hands are feeling dry
Using this metric bulbous is a far grosser word
People responding to a on why we hate the word so much
But there should be no expectation from either partner that this state of affairs will continue indefinitely
They should be able to have a relationship that does not involve anyone else
This is because I believe work should be truly voluntary
gt Society doesn t work if everyone goes around doing whatever they want all the time To a large extent we are vastly exaggerating the encroachments on individuality that we believe are necessary and should be reducing these encroachments in all areas both intimate and in employment
You re being hurt by jealousy and insecurities that you have not overcome but can
It is not moral to relinquish individuality
My agreement with them is that they re paid for actual work they do and I pay them handsomely for the work that is done well
Wanting your partner to share your interests is one thing
Everyone works from home and can have an environment they like
If you enter an agreement where you willingly become a slave we do not recognize this
The pain of a Muslim who saw a drawing of Mohammad is self inflicted and rooted in unhealthy beliefs
But blowing up when they ve purchased this one item that seems unnecessary to you is another
I make no impositions on their drug use or sobriety
If a person doesn t want another partner that s okay
But blowing up when they don t want to travel with you to this one particular country is another
Similarly when you say your marriage vows and make an implicit promise that your genitals will only ever touch your partner s this is giving away individuality
If monogamy works for you do it
But blowing up when they ve had a joint with a friend this one time is another
I do not require certain hours to be kept
But when it feels like you re being stabbed because your partner wants to express their love or lust with someone else you re not being hurt by them
This is your pain which you don t need to feel and would not feel if a sick culture wasn t telling you that you need to
The drawing is not even an insult unless you choose to interpret it that way
I do not wish to be that type of employer
Just like the pain of the Muslim seeing a drawing of Mohammad is a pain he doesn t need to feel and would not feel if his own sick culture wasn t telling him he needs to
Such an expectation is immoral immature insecure possessive jealous and selfish
I believe a large portion of our world of our economies is based on subtle slavery
I also expect my partner to be financially responsible to travel with me to not do drugs
If that happens to you nothing is wrong with it
Most of the time I also don t wish for any other partners than my wife
The two partners should enjoy such a relationship as long as it lasts and not attach strings
But do you think those Muslims believe themselves crazy They think they re justified amp 8211 as do you
You may think this comparison is unfair and hurtful because Muslims who call for beheadings are obviously crazy as opposed to you
At no point should a person expect from their partner to never want to be intimate with anyone else and at no point should a person make their partner promise such a thing
When a person physically stabs you it s their fault
Similarly expecting your partner to mostly be available to meet your needs is one thing
If you enter an agreement where you become an indentured servant we do not recognize this
Expecting a person to not be intimate with others and expecting a person to tolerate such intimacy are the same type of coercion
Just don t try to make that happen with coercion
The pain of a person whose partner was intimate with someone is similarly self inflicted and rooted in unhealthy beliefs
I think the companies that practice these encroachments are in fact being immoral and are exploiting negotiating leverage
What I m saying is that we need to go beyond just a legal position and recognize that morally also these promises should not have our respect
I m not saying monogamous people do not deserve relationships to the extent that they simply don t want other partners
Expecting your partner to generally be financially responsible is one thing
I believe we should be acting to change this and the first place to start is with intimate relationships that ought to be loving
I make no imposition that they cannot quit their jobs at any time and go work for a competitive company
However I am saying that the proper way to do that is by being monogamous yourself not by holding someone else amp 8211 your partner amp 8211 to a strict monogamous expectation
Society is based on contracts employment agreements also encroach on individuality gt When you sign up for a job you agree be at a certain place awake and sober and perform tasks for hours on end regularly in return for money
What I m saying however is that people do not deserve relationships to the extent that they want to impose monogamous restrictions on their partner
I make no requirements encroaching on them that are not absolutely necessary
As a society we do not recognize agreements that attempt to take away a person s individuality
Legally this promise is not enforceable
If two people do not want other partners that is great
As an employer I take steps to maximize my employees individuality
Expecting your partner to not smoke pot all day and your home to not be full of smoke is one thing
But blowing a gasket because this one time they flirted kissed had safe sex with someone is another
Only to the extent that a cartoonist drawing Mohammad and a fanatic calling for beheading in response are the same type of insult
You re ignoring that monogamy works fine for so many people I m not ignoring that
Such a promise keeps these non respectable qualities even if at one point in time the promise and the desire to make it are mutual
If monogamy truly works long term both for you and for your partner you will walk into it by happenstance

Women in particular are the ones who get this sorta flack the most
Before I begin I would like to clarify that my definition of the word whore slut tramp and the like when I was growing up meant a Woman Girl who had a lot of sexual partners and this is the definition I will be discussing here today
But what happens when a guy has a lot of sex He get s applauded for it
So why then is having sex with a lot of people viewed as bad Especially when you re taking the proper measures to make sure both you and your partner are safe and you are not going to produce an unwanted baby
It s very easy yet also extremely nasty to call a fellow girl a whore slut tramp etc when you want to discredit her
A person s view of what sex is and how it should be done is different for everyone
So why is it bad for a girl to have a lot of sex I get that girls sexual wiring is different from guys as they generally leads to them having different lower sex drives
Even gay guys like myself don t get flack for having a lot of casual sex but generally our straight allies don t tend to question our behavior all that much
But in the end I doubt anyone would dispute the claim that a desire for sex is one of the most natural things about being human secondary only to wanting food water shelter and on equal standing to a desire for life fulfillment and companionship
But when a girl DOES have a high sex drive and doesn t want a relationship WHY IS THAT BAD Footnote Any girls out there reading this who like having lots of sex GOOD FOR YOU MAN
It s almost like it is encouraged
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
It s implied that a woman is somehow dirty or is a low life or what have you simply because she chooses to have a lot of sex
1 By creating the Primarchs he puts the fate of mankind for the next 10 000 years in the hands of 21 individuals
3 Unable to screen out unreliable leaders seriously Lorgar and Angron were clearly unreliable and unfit for command from the get go
So basically the Emperor creates a system where pretty much all power is centered on 18 21 individuals creates a system in which the imperium s best armies can easily be turned on itself fails to protect or pre empt their corruption by an obvious threat and seems unable to understand how to play politics in a military Junta
The net result of this is a galactic civil war which destroyed the project he wanted to build and turned the imperium into the opposite of what he wanted it to be
A historical human dictator like Cromwell or Stalin probably would have done better
4 How does he expect to keep knowledge of the Chaos gods a secret during the Great Crusade In a universe where he knows that atheism is objectively wrong that gods and hell objectively exist and that the chaos gods have already screwed around with the primarch project how does he expect to keep their existence a secret What exactly prevents them from corrupting one of this primarchs They were going to find out about chaos either way better to hear it from the emperor himself first than from daemon possessing them
Any intelligence dictator would have kept both them as far away from any sort of military power as possible
He willingly allows them to command legions despite the fact that both were opposed to the imperium s ideals
The fact that each primarch is a demigod means that they will be the most important people in the imperium
This is not the hallmark of stable governing nor military institutions
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
He also seems oblivious to the fact that seriously humiliating Lorgar on Monarchia would have destroy his loyalty
2 Inability to recognize the problematic nature of the primarch and their legions For someone who supposedly lived through the Roman Republic Empire he sure seems eager to repeat the exact mistakes the Romans made with their military The Roman Republic fell largely because the legions were loyal to their generals rather than to the Republic and eventually turned on Rome when their generals had disagreements with the civil government
If the general orders the marine to revolt the marine should be arresting the general
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
The obvious lesson that every subsequent successful dictator learned is that you have to keep the reins on the army and that the army must be loyal to you personally and not the general you appointed to command them
This degree of centralization of power is dangerous because it only takes one or two of them to go bad for the entire imperial project to be endangered
Yet the most of the traitor legion marines turned out to be more loyal to their own primarch than the emperor
The Scenario is as such Hypothetical question You see two homeless people and want to buy them each a meal but can only afford one
direct because I ve gotten no response from any of the people I ve put the query to and I m interested to see how people willing to challenge their own beliefs would take it
I m not willing to buy for the other homeless person but I ll buy for the Muslim person
Both the homeless people are now being fed instead of one of them if you agree to the offer
Would you watch someone actually go hungry for theoretical moral superiority or would you be willing to recognize that the greater good in this instance is making sure both people are fed _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
However the housing unit in question was built by the Muslim community in question and would not have existed without their financing
Someone else comes up and says I m willing to buy that Muslim person a meal
Because you can t feed both
You have money for one and someone is offering to feed the other no matter how bigoted their offer may appear
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
My view is that this is okay because even if they re removing 166 Muslim families from the overall pool this discriminating practice they re functionally adding 166 spots for non Muslims to the available pool of subsidized housing
That s the first query I d like a response to
Do you turn it down based on principal and let one of the two go hungry If you say no in this scenario either you re feeding someone you would have fed anyway and letting the Muslim person go hungry for no good reason but to feel better about how equal and egalitarian you are or you re feeding the person who has another offer of food and letting the person with no other offers of food go hungry
Alright so this was inspired by the recent debate in about a Toronto man who was issued a letter denying him government subsidized housing at a Muslim specific residence because he wasn t Muslim and how this discrimination was wrong
The issue seems really complex to me but at the moment that is what I think
Often times when they did this they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development
To be honest I m not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement
I know most Europeans Americans would respond to this by saying I had nothing to do with this why should I take responsibility over the past but I find that to be a really weak argument
However I still feel like they have to own up to that problem
If my grandfather robbed somebody of something died and passed the stolen goods money down to me don t I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items even if I had nothing to do with the crime I think I would
But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people s past seems very selfish to me

Currently the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans
Most Europeans say with much accuracy that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a immigrants are a weight on the economy and b most migrants refuse to assimilate creating a lot of social problems

It s a word people treat as though it refers to some real objective truth when it doesn t
I m saying the concept of worth itself as it pertains to people is not real
I also believe holding onto this idea that it does mean something more concrete is often harmful to the one who believes it
For example if you define worth as speed of completing task x then you can say one person is worth more than the other in that context by that specific definition
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Thinking they have some objective ranking of worth as a person among all other people serves to bring unnecessary emotional turmoil to many if they believe they don t rank high
Let me stress I m not just saying no one is worthless
But to just generally say This person is worth more than that person or I m worthy or I m worthless is far too general and vague to actually refer to anything about reality
Well I personally think that mass donations to politicians is blatant problem since if someone gives you millions of dollars people expect you to do something for them as well
The argument is that this will allow for unions and rich people to form public opionion but the same argument can be made to some celerities who convinced their supporters to vote for Obama by posting support for him or News channels that have a political bias such as MSNBC and FOX News
Overall I think donations should be limited but attack ads and campaigning for a candidate is a part of freedom of speech
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators

The theory isn t backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn t that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier
The widespread belief or following of most organized religions is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways
This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions merely an observation i have come to
This is what i would call a weakness
But a motivation to believe in a creator
The need for moral guidance in life to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong
A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale
EDIT Keep the comments coming guys i ll secede on that point moral guidance is not evidence for human weakness
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death and the impermanence and futility of our lives
Furthermore the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do bad things and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good
Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human nature is bad or barbaric in a sense

There were also other notable successes and I can imagine this technology becoming very useful to law enforcement
The technology is not used to look inside people s homes it only captures what they re doing outside in the open i
It gives the authorities a time lapse perspective of events taking place in the area under surveillance

And yes obviously it is possible to not consume factory farmed meat products but the amount of people who exclusively do that is so small that it doesnt really have any relevance to anything and its safe to assume almost everyone who will post in this thread eats mcdonalds and buys chicken from the supermarket

Disarming the police would reduce the need for criminals to carry firearms and so generally reduce the perceived need to carry a gun by citizens
When asked UK police officers say overwhelmingly that they wish to remain unarmed
By removing this normalcy of this type of weapon is reduced and a reduced rate of gun related homicide should be seen
This is borne out in countries like the UK and applies specifically to guns rather than all non lethal arms
Because criminals tend to be armed normal citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against those criminals
I believe that the main incentive for carrying a firearm when committing a crime is that you may need to defend yourself against armed police
A 2006 survey of 47 328 Police Federation members found 82 did not want officers to be routinely armed on duty despite almost half saying their lives had been in serious jeopardy during the previous three years
Most people treat him rather poorly as he acts like a wild animal fairly often but I also pity him as he truly believes he is a wolverine
All three people think they are something that they are not so I feel that societies responses should be consistent either 1
Let me preface this by stating that I don t believe in judging shunning or harassing people because of who they are I just don t know why their choices are a thing to be celebrated and supported Stories I was walking down the street in a large city and there was a homeless man sitting in a corner mumbling about how he was a starship flying through space
Treat all 3 cases as mental illness
Celebrate this and have the person live their lives in their own manner
A young man who frequents a card shop I visit believes himself to be a wolverine
Realize that mental illnesses exist and if there is no cure it is something that must be managed just as with bi polar multiple personality disorder etc
Either we treat all three as varying levels of delusion mental illness or we work as hard as we can to make those people feel right in society
A previously homosexual previously male friend of mine recently came out as trans meaning that he would like to live life as a woman
Now I have no problem with any of the three people
I view all these 3 stories as on the same spectrum and should be treated the same
I pitied him as he to genuinely believe that he was an actual starship and assuming no drugs were involved I expect most of society also does
My male friend can live and be treated like any woman that young man at the card shop can live and be treated like a wolverine and that older man can be free to pursue a career at NASA as a test shuttle or whatever

I hear a lot about modern feminism being closely related or even incorporating LGBT into itself and this makes very little sense to me
Equality of opportunity can only truly exist if male and female people are perceived as equal in every way as long as humans and inherent human bias are still factors this is one issue I have with Feminism in general but not the point of this CMV
Ideally in a feminist world as I see it genders would be identical in interaction both socially and in work and biological sex either disregarded or put onto a spectrum in which case transgenderism could be considered a purely cosmetic change
Beacause of this I see transgenderism as either meaningless in the context of Feminism or a stepping stone for a pseudo Orwellian future of counter constructive normality
The current reason as I see it is that they fit better into their reassigned gender roles which I respect but gender roles would be eliminated by many feminists given a chance
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
My view is that this directly contradicts the very idea of transgenderism and even to an extent homosexuality in that it removes the unorthodoxy in interaction between gender in non traditional ways not via acceptance but by unifying the genders

My argument is if guns were more difficult or impossible to get access to Bryce Williams would have just added it to the list of hinderances he ignored and still gone through with it
Despite the consequences that he would face legally he decided to go through with it
Hypothetically not having access to a fire arm I believe he would have still gone through the act of trying to kill Alison and Adam by another means
However I believe that in instances of premeditated murder tougher gun laws would not prevent these events
Despite the pain he would cause to the families of the Alison and Adam as well as his own he decided to go through with it
Despite all of the reasons not to go through with it he decided to go through with it
Secondly I am not coming from the pro or anti gun legislation perspective
While watching the comments role through in yesterday s r news thread several comments mentioned the desire for tougher gun laws
Yesterday s events were a tragedy
May Alison and Adam rest in peace
If I could remove all guns from the world and safely fill the sport and personal self defense gaps with something else with a single wish I would
Firstly my heart goes out to the victims and by no means am I making excuses or defending any actions
I wanted to talk specifically about premeditated murder and the role firearms play in them
Having grown up on Smith Mountain Lake and spent countless days on the very docks that the incident took place and having gone to the same school as Alison the events hit really close to home
I am going to repeat myself a few times but bear with me Despite all of the reason for Bryce Williams not to commit yesterday s crime he still decided to go through with it
I so badly want to believe that we can prevent incidents like yesterday s from happening through tougher gun legislation or any other way but I cannot see how
Despite the hate and vitriol his memory would leave he decided to through with it

However by continuing to use the word they merely keep the term in use in modern language and create awkward circumstances for other races for whom it s not socially acceptable to be used in even the most positive contexts
Lastly how would language truly suffer by the removal of this particularly nasty word Language evolves and adapts over time and if the majority of people both black and white actively discourage its use eventually it will die out and the English language will be better for it
There are plenty of derogatory terms throughout history that have faded from use and are no longer relevant and I think given the inflammatory nature of the word as well as the shameful history it represents it should be actively avoided even in positive contexts which only serve to perpetuate its use

These are commonly known as concealed carry weapons permits or a CCW
This question is not about any of those things
Edit added a tl dr to alleviate any confusion about my point
tl dr Every US state should make CCW permits easy to obtain for law abiding citizens
Currently many US states issue a permit allowing any legal firearm owner to carry a concealed weapon in public
Dislaimer I do not intend for this to become a debate about gun culture and gun policy as a whole
There are no states or cities in the US where CCWs are expressly prohibited however many states and cities have de facto prohibited CCWs by making the eligibility criteria almost impossible for most citizens to meet
Considering that criminals routinely carry and use guns and knives on citizens why shouldn t every state freely issue CCWs to persons with qualifying criminal records Keep in mind that most southern and midwestern states have done this for decades and their streets have not turned into Shootout at the OK Corrall
I will even say as a self declared gun nut I think there are some very good arguments to be made about waiting periods mandatory firearms training restricting magazine size etc
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things

A journalist s job is to report the news not to create them
Who decides when a candidate can be disrupted or not People mostly agree that the activists who disrupted Sanders were out of line but when it s Trump it s ok The presidential race is an extremely important one for this nation and should be treated seriously and with respect
Political statements being unruly and making accusations does not constitute journalism and not why Univision sent him there
Ramos made himself a news item when he trolled presidential candidate Donald Trump during a press conference
The press conference was not there to allow journalists to express their feelings about issues
If we instead agree that trolling presidential candidates is OK if they had it coming then it opens the floodgates to anyone who dislikes a candidate to disrupt our democratic process
However whether you hate him or not trolling a presidential candidate during a press conference is an embarrassment to the nation makes a mockery of out our democratic process and coming from a journalist should lead to a dismissal
I m not a fan of Trump I would not vote for him and I don t think he ll get the nomination
After such unprofessional behavior became public and a national news item Ramos should ve been fired immediately

Victim is somewhat of a loose term here so before you shout victim blaming I ll freely state that yes I believe victims are very rarely 100 free from some kind of responsibility
When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely
Here s my basic line of thought Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate
That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large lasting scale
I m happy to edit for any needed clarification
But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset in the cops mind he s just another loud black person which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype
Obviously I m not proposing an over night fix to any social issue but what I m proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping
It s much easier to take preventative measures and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be
This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored
Well if that stereotype upsets you as a man the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig But nobody seems to realize this they just want everyone else to do what they ask
If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur
Several of society s popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes or the stereotypes themselves
Pointing the finger at the aggressor doesn t actually help solve the whole problem all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off
Another quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying not all men are pigs
We might be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled but we can t prove something like that
In fact I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view hence this post
An example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed arrested or worse after arguing with resisting the police officer

Edit Many of the replies focus on the media glorification of shooters turning them into celebrities
Only in this way can the root cause mental illness be addressed and not just ignored
I m not entirely sure if I agree with the no attention to the gunmen philosophy after tragic shootings
Edit 2 By warning signs and intervention I clearly don t mean in the face of an ongoing shooting
This would then shift the celeb dom paradigm to a mental illness paradigm which I think is important for both the general public and the confused people who are considering committing such acts
Regarding this most recent case of the journalist and cameraman I read that the news staff unanimously noticed odd and hostile behavior from the now shooter and their response was to fire him
Contrarily if we looked past the urge to dismiss the shooter as inhumane and instead welcome them to forgiveness and treatment it may be an important step in bridging the disconnect between the mentally ill and mentally healthy it may also prompt the mentally ill to seek help early before the illness becomes uncontrollable
I think we can all agree that a major part of the problem is mental illness and as hard as it may be to forgive someone for an atrocious crime like this we have to understand that the shooter s reality is far far different from a normal reality
While firing him entirely justifiable since his behavior was interfering with his ability to perform his job perhaps this odd and hostile behavior deserved some recognition discussion and possible intervention I wouldn t know specifically what since I m not a practicing psychologist psychiatrist but if his behavior was peculiar enough to warrant removing him from his job perhaps an expert would agree that this is a sign that intervention or some type of discussion is appropriate
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators

The invocation of that right must be unambiguous and silence is not enough to invoke it
Now my view point is that it should be a form of opt out not opt in
The rulings are going against what the 5th Am wanted in the first place along with the SCOTUS ruling back in 1966
The following court cases are related to my view On June 13 1966 in Miranda v
Voluntarily and knowingly responding to police interrogation after remaining silent constitutes a waiver of the right to remain silent provided that a Miranda warning was given and the suspect understood it
For those who are not aware the gives citzens the right to remain silent
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Thompkins the SC ruled that A suspect s silence during interrogation does not invoke his right to remain silent under Miranda v
It s recommended that you remain silent until you have a lawyer working for you so you can tell your side of the story to them along with the lawyer being with you to tell you what you should and should not say
Arizona the SC ruled that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination requires law enforcement officials to advise a suspect interrogated in custody of his rights to remain silent and to obtain an attorney
You shouldn t have to go to the police during your arrest after they read you your Miranda Rights I would like to invoke my right to remain silent as per the 5th Amendment
On June 17 2013 in Salinas v
On June 1 2010 in Berghuis v
I think if this way is kept it could lead to some free people getting into trouble with the courts
Of course the SCOTUS can go against previous rulings but they seem to be keeping this one as it s important for civil liberties
If you are stupid enough to go Hey man that LSD wasn t even mine it s just your sayings can and will be used against you

I m sure reddit would have no problem with a subreddit cataloging how being obese is unhealthy and unsustainable
Racism is pretty much universally acknowledged as a bad thing by non racists
I see no problem with trigger warnings asking for trigger warnings banning FPH and coontown and working towards making reddit a safe space
Ever had a TV show tell you Viewer discretion is advised Or heard a news reporter say Some viewers may find the following footage disturbing That s a trigger warning
And FPH wasn t just demeaning and harassing people people attracted to reddit for it and subreddits like it spilled over leading to phrases like FPH is leaking
This comes the closest to actually just blocking out opposing ideas but it still doesn t quite reach it
In addition FPH even harassed some of its targets off reddit making them feel physically unsafe
No subreddit exists in a vacuum
Lastly the idea of a safe space
Also it doesn t make much sense for them to host racist content
Oddly enough trigger warnings have existed off the internet and college campuses for decades
This is mostly a counter argument to the outrage over PC culture and reddit s recent decision to nuke FPH Coontown etc
They claim it is an attempt to shut out opposing views and ideas and it is an insult to those with PTSD

We are a free society a free nation
Cults are often cults of personality the worship of a single person the cult leader
Like same sex marriage I can see no ethical dilemmas brought upon by introducing polygamous marriages besides the religious
Does that mean that they should be illegal because they deviate from the norm This is does not exclude the possibility of non abuse marriages by non Islamic non cultist polygamous marriages
If there was a high amount of abuse among marriages surely this would be seen in gay and lesbian ones as well
Prior to European colonization many cultures from around the world practiced polygamous marriages for thousands of years
Could we then not point to India and exclaim that same sex marriage simply does not work Some argue that there are simply too few people interested in a polygamous lifestyle for people to protest its ban or for legislation to be passed to overturn it
The only problem I could see occurring in polygamous marriages is the destruction of traditional marriage however this has been argued to have been a problem with same sex marriage
There has been the concept of non religious marriages involving multiple partners for men and women since the hippy era of the United States
Many things are legal that few people practice
Now after decolonization this has been shrunk to mostly the Middle East Indonesia West Asia Myanmar and most of Africa
However if we look at who is practicing polygamy and where it is currently legal can we truly say that the type of marriage is at fault Most nations where polygamy is legal are Islamic nations
This is once again a bad example
Our nation is not built upon religious foundations we are a secular state therefore using Christian morals to argue what is marriage what is not is not a viable reason to keep polygamy illegal
Can we expect a person who has made themselves out to be something of a prophet to respect their spouses or basic human rights Probably not
I see nothing wrong with polygamy
There have been some that have argued in the past that polygamous marriages have a higher rate of abuse of women
Who in the United States is practicing polygamy More often than not cults
The religion in and of itself is not known for being respectful towards women nor tolerant of them deviating from the wishes of their husband
Why should we decide how many a man or woman chooses to marry Who are we to deny these marriages Are we so morally superior that we can dictate that marriage must be between two individuals I do not see the appeal of polygamous marriage however I do not see myself as one to judge
This is true however it does not change the absurdity of being against it
Let s think for a moment and say that a nation like India happened to be the first to legally same sex marriage
Can we truly say that abuse would become less prevalent in Muslim countries if all marriages were suddenly turned to monogamous ones Others will point to certain cults that have split off from the main Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and speak of their abuse against women and even rampant pedophilia
No matter what your conscious reasoning you cannot escape the fact that the reason you care about looking good at all is because you were raised in a culture where it is practically screamed in your face every day that A GOOD WOMAN IS BEAUTIFUL A GOOD WOMAN IS ATTRACTIVE Therefore when a woman claims that she dresses makes up so that she can feel good about herself it doesn t matter
You are doing what the patriarchal system has dictated to you that you must do and in so doing you are reinforcing that system
It doesn t matter what you claim because the end result is the same you ARE pleasing and attracting men and you are valuing yourself based on attractiveness
It doesn t even matter if you re not straight

Places like Hungary are building fences
If you look at the growing problems with migrants in Greece amp Macedonia

Criticism that ranges from racists to fascists

Those resources are being kept from people who should have access to them
Countries are left to fend for themselves and they will look out for themselves
But in order for them to make a better life they need resources to do so
If you look at the problem expanded immigration has caused in France Germany Greece England and many other nations you begin to sympathize with taking measures to stop it
has unlimited resources and that any and all should have access to them

I think it s clear that modern feminism is much more than just that belief and that it s totally reasonable to believe that women and men should be equal but not be feminist
However it can be off putting to somebody who doesn t really fit the identities feminism focuses on I think it s perfectly reasonable for a guy who isn t interested in discussing female identity in modern society to not identity as feminist or even feel abandoned by it
I ll preface this with saying that I m a guy and I consider myself extremely feminist and would disagree with the criticisms for feminism for other reasons
Other policies like supporting abortion maternity leave etc
3rd wave feminism is more than just wanting equality Feminism has evolved from just women deserve equal rights to a discussion about what it means to be female This type of discussion is really interesting and really important
Until more of those exist and are promoted it doesn t make much sense to expect men to identify as feminist
Unfortunately there s not many misogyny free communities for discussing men s issues
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
There are multiple valid perceptions of equality some of which do not lend themselves to modern feminism The perception of equality that most critics of feminism would subscribe to would be a pretty basic equality of opportunity where women are given the same legal rights as men
I personally believe this is the right way to go about things but it s it would technically violate the very strict interpretation of equality
There are plenty of ways that feminism helps men but those issues tend to be on the back burner
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
For example many biases prevent women from succeeding in certain fields so feminists would often embrace some form of affirmative action or grants for women in these fields
all attempt to create equality by making physical factors that advantage men over women less of an issue would fit the same argument as above
For the most part this sense of equality is achieved in the developed world and feminism doesn t seem extremely necessary The more feminist perception of equality is a more complex view of equality of opportunity that attempts to achieve equality through other actions

Historically the DJIA has had value since it was one of the first indices to ever be widely used

There are many other indices which represent a broader swath of the market
However we ve developed better ones since then and it s time to stop paying attention to the DJIA
The biggest problem with the DJIA is that it is price weighted which means that higher priced stocks carry far more influence than lower priced ones
The dollar value of an individual share of one company cannot be meaningfully compared to the price of an individual share of another company if companyA has a share price of 1 with 1000 shares outstanding it is a far more important market indicator than companyB which has a share price of 100 with 5 shares outstanding
I grew up with a dog who I don t think has become reasonably happy being confined to a small residential backyard and having no other dogs to be around
If I lived out in the country with a dog free to run around chase rabbits and squirrels and actually follow me around daily it d make for a satisfying pet
I don t like the norm of pet in my country
HOWEVER I am not convinced that it s worth my while to raise numerous dogs on my own or that I d be happy with a single dog while living in a community that doesn t otherwise provide a social community for the dog
Every time he can run down the street and get out of sight of his owners he does and now he s extremely uncomfortable around other dogs since he never grew up around them
I don t think this practice is well suited to fostering happy lovable animals
I would never care to own a dog while I m living in a city
I m convinced that if I could provide a social community of other dogs on a daily basis as Crooooow and themcos described I d be happy with the dog I raise
By small I mean about less than an acre typically without a garden livestock or other activities to occupy my time outside on my own property for a sizable amount of the day

Looking at things purely in terms of rights creates a selfish narcissistic entitled unreasonable mindset
People talk about natural or God given rights but all rights can be taken from you
If rights like free speech or free association are inalienable natural or God given how come so many people don t have them
No rights are absolute the world would be screwed if they were
Can I pursue happiness by running over the elderly in my F150 or selling crack to toddlers But I got the right right All rights have limits
I hear alot of people claiming The right to free speech or The right to the pursuit of happiness
Laws about inciting violence truth in advertising libel slander pornography threats extortion racial vilification sexual harassment tax fraud and many many more all limit free speech but are vital for society
Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin but there s no Bill of Responsibilities
Looking at the world in these terms is false misleading and detrimental to society
Rights are created by the state on their terms
Talking about Rights like this makes people think they can do what they want coz I got Rights
Rights are a myth and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom
Just running with the example of Lester we see him smoking pot quitting his job buying the car he wants listening to music he likes in an effort to become cool again so that Angela will have sex with him
He craves what he lacks drive energy youth
Lester wants youth and drive so he tries to reach out and grab it
Jane wants to be loved so she seeks out Ricky who seems to love her
The time in which the characters truly find themselves happy is the pursuit of these ideals
What is so bad about the presentation of Carolyn s character I actually really liked her
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
For each character their direct counterpart is perceived as the thing that s making them unhappy
I believe that at its core American Beauty is a cautionary tale about complacency and placing responsibility for happiness in the hands of others
If Lester didn t need Carolyn to do everything for him
Carolyn wants success so she tries to reach out and grab it
The chief argument toward the sexism of the film is the presentation of Carolyn as controlling but I don t believe this is what the viewer is meant to conclude just like I don t believe the viewer is really supposed to see Lester s complete regression to his teenage years as a victory
All of the characters do what everyone misguidedly does when they want something
Let me begin by explaining the movie as I understand it
She craves actual success and fulfillment
I feel as though Carolyn s shitty elevator music is meant to be the same as Lester s annoying rock music
If Carolyn could just stop being so controlling
Every main character embodies this in a different way and by failing to have agency
If Jane could just be more normal
Carolyn Has over a long period of time leveraged her beauty and sexual aggression for productivity and image
It s not what they want that makes them happy it s possessing agency again
Angela Sacrifices personality for status in the form of physical beauty
They try to reach out and grab it
All of the character arcs are similar to this
I just watched American Beauty after many years of managing to somehow avoid it and I thoroughly enjoyed it
What he doesn t realize until the very end is that it s being a pretty cool guy that s actually making him happy in the first place
He sees what he wants and he patiently engineers a situation where what he wants comes to him
If everyone would just care about Jane instead of themselves even for a second
However this does not seem to be the way that a vast majority of people interpreted the film
The foil to this idea is of course Ricky a character who ironically maintains his agency throughout the film making himself happy by doing nothing
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Stupidly after watching I decided to take to the internet and I managed to piss myself off by reading about the apparent misogynist sexist agenda of the movie
Angela wants to be seen as extraordinary so she flirts with Lester who clearly thinks she is
I ve said a lot but what I m really trying to get at is that the characters in this film are all extremely congruent to one another in a way that transcends age sex and even primary goals and motivations
Lester Has over a long period of time leveraged his time and energy to afford things he no longer has the drive to use
Aside from the fact that they describe magical happenings they can t even get things like the year he was born right
One gospel suggests that Jesus was born around 5 BC another suggests 6 AD
It s possible he also spoke Greek but you would think the Gospels would have been written in Aramaic originally if they were genuine accounts of Jesus s life
Can anyone point me to some evidence that proves Jesus was in fact a real man who was born under Herod performed miracles in front of masses of crowds and went fishing with his buddies in the freshwater Sea of Galilee only to be killed for it I m not looking at this from a snarky anti theist view though I do happen to be an atheist
Eventually decades later some literate Greek believers most likely in Anatolia wrote made up biographies of this preacher s life and tacked on moral sayings they attributed to him
Despite what people popularly say we do have much more evidence for Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great than we do for Christ
The Principle of Embarrassment is a very weak argument
We just don t know enough about the context of that era
I think their confidence is unwarranted and here s why We have ZERO evidence of any Christian activity whatsoever before Paul wrote Galatians around 40 60AD and no conclusively Christian artifacts have been found dating any earlier than 70 AD
That s to be expected of course but considering how popular the Gospels portray Jesus as being and how much of Israel has been dug up you d think we d have SOMETHING from his lifetime attesting to his existence
Since it s obvious the magical parts didn t happen is it really that radical to come to the conclusion the whole story is a work of fiction I think what happened is there was a preacher in Israel at the time who claimed to be God and tried to overthrow the Roman client state with his followers and was executed for it
Some of these stories became very popular to the extent that people were willing to die for their faith
Supposedly Jesus was already attracting huge crowds during his lifetime and Israel has been studied extensively by archaeologists for a long time
In other words there may have been a person who Jesus was very loosely based on but the Jesus that Christians worship is essentially a character from political fanfiction
Either that or entirely made up
I just don t think the evidence is compelling or very convincing
Right now there is almost an unanimous consensus among scholars that Jesus was a real human being
You would think we would find some sort of trinket or writing contemporary to his life but we ve found nothing
Paul seems to be writing about a heavenly Jesus not an earthly one at times in his letters
The attestations by Josephus Tacitus and Suetonius are very dubious
Israel was already very literate during Christ s time
They even go as far as comparing the Christ myth theory to the Moon Landing conspiracy theories and Holocaust deniers
His followers mostly poor illiterates started telling tall tales about things he supposedly did while he was alive
The Gospels are written in Greek

Rather than addressing the symptoms of illegal immigration why not address the cause and try to find ways to defuse the magnet
Illegally immigrating to the US will become much less attractive if parents must provide papers or and ID to get birthright citizenship and by denying legal visitors this right we can also dissuade the whole birth hotel and anchor baby phenomenon
This obviously doesn t address the 10 million illegal immigrants already here but it will do much to help stem the flow of further illegal immigrants from now on
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I m not super passionate about illegal immigration policy but I do think the birthright citizenship portion of the 14th Amendment has become a liability on our country and encourages people to move into the US illegally if only to provide a better life for their family
Regardless of their motives they break the law and the government should enforce the law of the land

I see artists like Kanye West Justin Bieber Win Butler and Miguel who get a lot of flack for saying that they re great artists or that they make better music than other artists
And what s wrong with publicly stating that Usually he responds that way when the questions are loaded and they re looking for a controversial answer anyway
If Kanye really believes that he s this generation s Kurt Cobain and that his music transcends entertainment then good on him as that s the exact type of mentality that will push him to try and create that type of timeless music
I think it s a healthy mentality to love yourself and anything you do and it can be separate from conceitedness

However alcohol consumption to the point of feeling drunk has negative health effects
I completely agree that if getting drunk with your friends gives you additional utility by all means drink at night
However if you are simply looking for that strong buzz now and again
Getting drunk at night assuming a normal sleep schedule typically entails falling asleep while drunk
Your body is still experiencing the negative effects of alcohol while you sleep through the benefits of being drunk

I like making lists to discuss points so here goes 1 Women who need a program like WIC are not in a financial position to raise a baby 2 An abortion would be cheaper than 18 years of food stamps and Medicaid 3 I acknowledge that not all taxpayers support abortion due to difference in moral opinion but taxpayers aren t consulted on other moral matters anyway such as war corporate bailouts etc
4 while some recipients of WIC may be in their position due to uncontrollables such as spouse death job loss etc it still takes two people to make a baby so both parties should be able to financially support a child without spousal help 5 one should not rely on government programs to assist with raising children in event those programs are taken away

In fact when your A C unit breaks you might not owe rent for days its broken because the unit is only livable while the A C is working per Texas law
much to my dismay 9 10 apartments I viewed do not include refrigerators in the lease
That gives them very strong incentive to hurry up and fix it already
There s a lot of illegal bait and switch going on in the apartment rental market
California law should mimc Texas law When a habitable condition appliance breaks the landlord is losing rent money every day it sits broken
Such as people from other states who it never occurred to them that a fridge might not be included
The first apartment I went to I was like WHAT NO FRIDGE I found out via r personalfinance that in Texas an air conditioning unit is a habitable condition meaning the landlord must provide and repair it
He said oh well I must have made a mistake online
You re not fooling any damn body you listed imaginary apartment with fake pictures just to get people to show up so you can start throwing sales shit at them
If Texas does this with air conditioners why cant California do this with a damn refrigerator _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I believe every other state requires this as a habitable condition correct me if I m wrong
Sometimes in areas where the market is really hot people sign for apartments without having seen the inside first
I caught a landlord in this lie just yesterday
Just moved to California starting look for an apartment
There are several reasons state law should change to make a fridge a habitable condition
This also happens with dishwashers and with rent prices
You might say well they should read the lease before they sign but that logic only holds up in theory
Making a fridge an optional amenity gives landlords the ability to LIE and say the unit comes with a fridge and then when they move in they find out that the fridge belonged to the previous tenants
In reality you know there are people getting screwed over on this issue
I m shopping for an apartment now and I would say about half the listings that say fridge included are just outright lies
In Michigan when a unit is unlivable a tenant can break a lease with no penalty and no notice
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things

In my personal opinion an apartment without a fridge in not habitable wouldn t you agree but more importantly

Now instead of making the audience sympathize with him when he becomes understandably upset he is vilified to the tune of him being attacked by the jellyfish that SpongeBob no longer has control over
Worse yet the audience is instead lead to sympathize with SpongeBob
The music from SpongeBob s house plays for so long and so loud that it completely prevents Squidward from being able to sleep
Even after SpongeBob is advised by Squidward that taking a in wild animal as a pet is not a good idea he does not listen and predictably Squidward pays for it
This especially happens when he gets upset over SpongeBob s shenanigans that disrupt or destroy his hobbies or even basic functions such as sleeping
Yes there are a few times where the writers of the show have given the audience reasonable reason to take side with SpongeBob but for the most part Squidward is unfairly vilified
Take episode 15 of season 1 Jellyfish Jam for example SpongeBob decides to take in a jellyfish as a pet and looses control of the situation
How is our idea of the usefulness of psychedelics not just a huge delusion
For some people it works and for others it is just a waste of time
I have buyed into the movement that got accelerated by people like Terence McKenna Joe Rogan Steve Jobs and many more that psychedelics might change the world and are a key to enlightenment
While I have always claimed that psychedelics have done something for me I think that this is gradually changing
I cannot come up with many things they have done for me except teach me the value of meditation
That we use drugs like lsd to have fun with the pretext that they help us grow
We can then use those delusions for good or for bad to mold our view of reality as we want it
But I constantly find myself having to reevaluate the ideas that I ve come up with on trips and find out that they are incomplete or wrong
But they are called hallucinogens for a reason
They allow us to have delusions that vary in intensity based on the person and the dosage
I believe that we are mostly lying to ourselves
I ve had my fair share of psychedelic experiences with the goal to improve to learn more about myself
If we decide that makeup isn t worth the harm to animals I can get onboard that without an issue but if makeup is going to exist I still think that animal testing is the best option
Now that I ve given you a picture of my general stance on animal rights let me say that It seems to me that animal testing could be a cruel and painful thing to subject an animal to The only alternative I see is human testing
And I think this is worse since human health and safety takes precedence over that of animals
However I have no moral problems with eating meat or killing animals as I don t see that as cruel and people need to eat
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Either as part of the manufacturing process or on the end consumer
The only alternative I see that is better than animal testing would be if we had the technology to reliably predict all effects on humans in a lab without any interaction with an animal or human
My only exposure is seeing bottles that say not tested on animals and the hippy kids at school with stickers and posters saying stop animal testing Let me also say that I believe in compassion for animals I don t support battery farms or puppy mills because I don t believe that its necessary to subject animals to that level of degradation simply for economic benefit and i m willing to pay more money as a consumer to express that belief
EDIT So a lot of people are taking the angle of Medical uses are fine but cosmetic uses are just harm for our enternainment why not just get rid of all makeup and I am totally fine with that argument but that doesn t really change my view
I m not a big fan of hunting simply for sport though
However I have not been able to find anything suggesting this is true
So either change my view on animal testing or prove to me that companies that don t test on animals test in a lab without involving humans or animals and that their results are equally reliable to those based on animal testing
Even if people opt in and are paid to have mysterious substances tested on them I m quite sure it will be kids and mothers in the slums of bangladesh or some other equally desperate section of the population who is taking extreme actions for money out of desperation and to protect them I think that it is better to not give them such an option
There is plenty of cosmetics out there with no animal testing labels which is what got me thinking about this in the first place
So let me start off by acknowledging that I know absolutely nothing about this issue about its history or about the debate surrounding it
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
But here s the thing you can play sports without being stupid perform on stage without being a prima donna
What I will argue is that this is irrelevant to what a game like D amp D actually is and what it offers a group of people sitting around a table with beer and pizza
Do you like rolling dice Play a very very wide variety of the things
I think if everyone understood this it would be no less common to see it on people s shelves than any of your standard board games
You can set fire to the whole house
What sets D amp D apart from more socially acceptable pastimes isn t really in its actual execution but in the demographic we associate with it and our desire to not be of that demographic
If you take away the medieval dressing and put yourself in the picture instead of the fat pimply nerd you get something not much different from say Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit
Who you are doesn t depend on how you spend your free time
You can search the couch cushions for change
D amp D while it s managed to achieve pretty good cultural penetration tends to get a pretty bad rap
There s an element of chance and risk
Do you like dragons and swords Watch Game of Thrones
You have to know what you re good at what your odds are and what possible results your actions will have
I m actually not going to argue with that impression so much because frankly I m not convinced it isn t based in truth
Boiled down to its essentials the game is just a shared storytelling
I m a writer so while I enjoy a normal healthy social life I am still drawn to D amp D because it s the only way for me to engage the same parts of the brain I use in writing but with my friends
I ask you to interact with an imaginary landscape you explore that landscape with total freedom and we both rely on dice to keep us from knowing how our own story ends
We all intuitively understand this with most activities but the view of D amp D is so strong it makes us forget
For any given element of what the game requires there s already a mainstream activity that revels in it
There are a lot of reasons you could be interested in it and they aren t all Because I can t get laid on a Saturday night
I believe that if everyone were actually exposed to it beyond just the basic idea and the cultural stigma it would be widely played

For anyone who s never played it or anything like it here s the basic rundown I tell you that you walk into the living room of a house
Do you like crunching statistics in the service of a non real competition Play fantasy football
You can choose to interact with any of these given things but more importantly you can do anything else
It s basically a gigantic thought experiment a hypothetical situation that you get to navigate
Do you like to pretend to be a character Play a murder mystery game or you know act in something
The only thing governing your actions keeping this from being a game of straight up make believe is that there s a set of skills with accompanying numerical levels to determine whether you actually can do the thing you want
It s associated with basement dwelling BO heavy obese teens and college students particularly men
There s a table with a book on it a door that s closed so you can t see what it leads to and an open doorway through which you can see the next room which is larger and fancier
Ever become lucid at the end of a dream and wish you could stay That s sort of what D amp D offers
The story proceeds in our collective mind s eye with literally limitless choice and narrative flexibility
You can jump out the window
D amp D is a fairly complex example and I use it only because it s the most famous but there are others that share the fundamentals while being much simpler and more casual
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I even loathe reading and writing fantasy but I still love D amp D for what it offers me creatively
Since you can t do everything you want what you do choose suddenly becomes much more meaningful
Are you perceptive enough to find those coins Can you strike a match without burning yourself You can peruse the book but are you smart enough for it Your number with that skill along with a dice roll to add some randomness tells you if you pull it off

Steam should only recommend MOBA s to people who don t have many hours in them or have never played them before if you never played one or only started playing one trying out a few more could be a good idea
what they should do is recommend games of other genres because it s much more likely a dota player will buy another game play it for a while and then go back to dota than it is for a dota player to play dota AND another MOBA
8k hours of Dota 2 on Steam and 168 games with 100 hours on 5 games other than dota and Steam is constantly recommending me Dota like MOBA games it s annoying
but if you played let s say 100 hours maybe more it should never recommend them
there s almost no overlap between them
i m gonna talk about MOBA s but i think MMORPG s also fall into this discussion
the reason is that the MOBA market isn t a MOBA market it s the Dota market and the LoL market and the Smite market etc a person who plays a ton of Dota won t play your MOBA he s too busy playing Dota
I also consider myself an egalitarian but I do not consider egalitarianism and feminism to be the same
I believe feminism is a movement inspired by egalitarianism but solely focused on the societal disadvantages of women and I have no problem with that
I believe feminism is now more focused on destroying men via hate rather than supporting women via education
This is what I hope to challenge my view on
However I believe feminism is diverging from its originally intended path and now I am reluctant to support what I think it has become
I think this hate resembles the same mechanics of racism where prejudice allows for the destruction of an entire group and is motivated by ill will
In addition I believe this transition is due to a lack of organization
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I believe through my observations that the driving forces of feminism have become inspired by hate
Radicals have managed to speak louder than the rationals as often happens and due to the lack of organization a shift in control of the movement has occurred resulting in the movement being run by radical man haters
I certainly consider myself a feminist in the sense that I believe I recognize the presence of gender inequality in my community and I think a good way to attain complete equality among genders is to raise awareness of the inequalities between genders and the privilege based oblivion of many men

The arguments of the danger is real side often come from the book by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom
However whenever journalists ask the opinion of the Skeptics they invariably say something along the lines of AI is nowhere near close as if that refutes the point made by the danger is real side
The current participants in the debate seem to me to be organized in two camps with Stephen Hawking Elon Musk Bill Gates in one camp arguing that the dangers are great and real and the actual researchers in the field of AI machine learning and computer science expressing skepticism and even ridicule
This diverts attention from the core of the argument and reinforces the position of the Skeptics
The more possible scenarios they imagine for how AI can go wrong the more likely it seems to them
They ignore the terrible track record of futurology and present ever new extremely specific scenarios for how the future will come to pass
Both sides keep spewing more extreme versions of their positions as time goes by exacerbating the current state of the debate
The main point of it is not that AI will be here soon but that the value of the outcome of AI is uncertain but more likely to be negative
I have yet to see a single serious researcher answer any of the actual arguments
On the other hand the danger is real side while believing themselves to be supremely rational seem to ignore the tenets of their own belief when the other side repeat them back at them
It also argues that AI is likely to improve very rapidly once it has arrived
The concern about the potential danger of AI goes back a long time but recently it has broken through to the mainstream
The book provides several strong and some rather weak arguments for this
So I say Hitler was a good speaker but a terrible leader
And the claim that Hitler saved Germany from depression is false the economic reforms that pulled Germany s bacon out of the economic fire were done by and forced them into a situation where the only way to survive was to invade and plunder their neighbors
I disagree Hitler was a godawful leader as good leaders tend not to leave their countries into such total destruction
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Often when Hitler or Nazi Germany is brought up on reddit you ll see a comment along the lines of Sure Hitler was evil but you gotta admit he was a good leader or something along those lines with the idea being that Hitler was a pretty sharp leader who pulled Germany out of a depression and made it great again
Hitler ruined the previously successful economic situation made military alliances with Italy and Japan that did nothing for him except get him in further trouble with an American enemy and an Italian ally constantly needing help played hell with the warfront by sacking any general who crossed his opinion and spent valuable resources creating internal strife by persecuting his own people

Most of us just push it to the back of our minds most of the time As I type this people are being beheaded by ISIS starving to death having acid thrown in their face by their husbands all in the developing world
But they had religion and other superstitious beliefs to give it all at least meaning if not making it better
The real world just carries on us dealing with continuous anxiety and misery until we croak and fall face first into our cereal bowl
All we can do is push it to the back of our minds or delude ourselves but this doesnt change the fundamentally negative thing that is reality
All we can do is push it to the back of our minds or delude ourselves and we only do that so we can keep on so we can fuck so our offspring can keep on and continue to do that for a million more cycles
There is no point to it even in bleaker stories like ASOIAF there is at least a point a resolution an explosion of all the built up emotions and events

It is my view that the banners posted by the fraternity are merely expressing their desire to have sex with women and never say anything about sexual assault
I believe that in our current society heterosexual men are often shamed for expressing their sexuality
Our students campus community and alumni have been offended
So this post is mainly inspired by a recent event in the news when a fraternity was suspended for posting banners on their house
While we constantly educate students faculty and staff about sexual assault and sexual harassment this incident confirms our collective efforts are still failing to register with some
They might be vulgar because they carry a sexual implication but implying a desire to have sex with women is not inherently demeaning to women
Equating vulgar language with demeaning women is also a fallacy
Obviously any specific incident in which a heterosexual male is criticized may or may not be misogynistic based the context of the situation
Equating the two is a fallacy and is unfair to the men who made the posters
Furthermore the Fraternity president made the following statement equating the posters to demeaning women gt The Fraternity condemns the derogatory and demeaning language used on the banners
Such language has no place in our Fraternity or within any caring community such as that of ODU It is my view that no part of these banners were derogatory or demeaning to anyone
So people in my city are complaining that women are walking around topless in times square
I know that the punishments vary from country to country and it may seem more like a slap on the wrist in america but I think both examples are based on a ridiculous premise
Their fear is that the display of these sexual body parts is contributing to a decay in public decency
However in Islamic countries a woman s hair is seen as a sexual body part and their display is seen as contributing to the decay of public decency

Full disclosure my BS is in engineering not economics and I m an avowed socialist
Can anyone explain to me why something like the stock market has to exist or what benefit it is to the working class I m willing to do the reading if someone can point me in the right direction
When their speculation gets especially irresponsible because of completely unchecked greed the economy collapses and the working class is left holding the bag while the truly fantastically rich laugh all the way to the bank
Anyway it seems to me that the stock market exists solely to perpetuate the accumulation of wealth at the top by people who do nothing of value

I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point
To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too
The guy is then facing rape charges
However if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out this would not have been a story
Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this Shouldn t it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft After all men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality Of course there are certain things that should be equal
Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal
In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault
Can she then say Maybe that wasn t a good idea and then get off the hook 3
In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men
Why is this on the guy People use the phrase Victim Blaming and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk
This one has also bothered me
CMV _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong
If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment
I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard
So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree
To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect
What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn t have hit his wife
According to the United States Selective Service Act all men between ages 18 25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented
Now in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do women can also but only when its convenient
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn t a good idea and that the guy should have known better
How can the feminist movement suggest Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman but still say that men and women are equal
My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women but then that s my point

I m interested to see the other perspective
Happy CMVing Edit Cleaned the post up a little bit
gt Religion is an insult to human dignity
show me that my definitions of good person or evil thing are wrong
For example soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were just following orders out of a sense of patriotism or in order to protect their families
In order to CMV please convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things
It has done it many times and it will continue to do so
To me it s inflammatory anti religious nonsense
An evil thing is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad such as murder
In the case of this quote the outside force is religion
Perhaps I haven t properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words A good person is someone who wouldn t normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force
I ve seen people use this quote many times
Poverty can make good people do evil things
They can temporarily taking away people s sanity which causes them to do stupid things

Here is my case for why Trump real estate player reality TV entertainer and contender for GOP nomination for Presidential candidate is a performing a public good
Geographically this meant the South sparsely populated rural Western states amp Midwestern battlegrounds
Obviously a more competitive representative GOP is good for the US
For the GOP to change it would have to alienate some share of its current constituents and craft rhetoric policies that would attract growing populations
Hawkishness generally has become less favored since 2003
Demographically this meant working class and middle income white families especially outside large urban contexts
Economic factors that are pushing the middle working class downward will cause these groups to want for more government help though often this is muted by anti immigration or anti Federal government rhetoric
As a result Trump can run unharmed by serious questions and can say things that no politician could say
Demographically GOP constituents are shrinking AND do not fear government programs Minority voters are still joining the Democratic Party in larger numbers
However within the party social conservatives are still quite strong but at odds with business interests that need inclusive branding etc
The Democratic Party under Clinton also moved closer to the right on various economic defense policies
Finally as GOP strongholds become more developed and urban in character they become swing or purple states
Trump is enabling the GOP to do this by being the clown who can say anything
It is widely recognized that Trump is an entertainer with no real motivation to become President
In recent years social conservatives have become more distanced from mainstream US opinion and shrunk
This is also at odds with libertarian business interests
Coupled with his long media history it is understood that Trump will say anything to get attention
However he has clout from steady poll numbers
Crisis of the GOP The modern coalition was erected right before Reagan s election libertarians business interests social conservatives and generally defense hawks
His populism could force the GOP to at least recalibrate its messaging if not its policies downstream
Which is why representative democracies everywhere seem to have devolved into plutocracies
People are getting fed up with it and starting to support non establishment candidates or parties
It seems inevitable that our governmental systems trend from power being concentrated in one person to becoming more decentralized
TL DR People get fed up when the desires of their representatives clash with their own and revolt against any concentration of power
If you prefer less than 100 then you inherently think some people don t deserve to have their desires represented and are by definition against the ideas of democracy
At some point the desires of the smaller group of representatives clash with the desires of the many
Even countries without strong direct democracy movements are having candidates trending in that direction bernie sanders and jeremy Corbyn
If democracy is a scale from 1 100 where that s a percentage of who gets to vote so a dictatorship would probably be 0
A meritocracy is unachievable because there is no good process to select them
There isn t a practical selection process whereby we could choose people to do what s best for others
05 then it implies that people who are partial towards democracy would prefer the ideal state of 100 democracy
Which leads us to gt If we think that people are smart enough to elect representatives why are they not smart enough to vote on legislation directly Participation in sites like reddit prove that people want direct democracy which in government would be the ability to create and vote on legislation as if it were a post
000029 and representative democracy might be 0
Which is exactly what we re seeing in new political parties like the pirate party podemos syriza which all tend toward direct democracy
People get fed up with living under plutocracies that they feel they can t trust
My main points against representative democracy are People vote for their own interests and representatives are no different
If autocracy is at one end and direct democracy is at the other then representative democracy lies somewhere in the imperfect middle
There is no creativity when it comes to country music and it has not had a positive influence on the music industry
Country music was not always bad
Almost every song sounds exactly the same following the same chord structure tone and melodies
Although there may be a few exceptions to this the majority of modern country is awful redundant and lacks any sort of meaning
However today the country music culture is full of songs about booze trucks tractors and women
There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was

I am pretty good about recognizing the difference between problems with being gay vs the problems associated with societal acceptance or rejection because of being gay so I don t feel like that is my problem here
It isn t a moral stigma thing I just think we are handicapped and disordered from not being able to be a part of most basic of human tendency to be attracted to the opposite sex
The same PC identity stuff could be said of down s syndrome but we don t hesitate to call that a disorder
I suppose I cannot get away from the idea that being homosexual isn t right in the same way being a dwarf or down s syndrome isn t right
I am hopeful someone can but not optimistic to tell you the truth
I believe we that we have removed ourselves from the labels disordered or handicapped as a way to cope
Pretty much every gay teenager would take a pill to be straight if they could and most parents would want the same
I feel like we are physiologically handicapped and that I just need to accept that and cope with it despite the politically correct thing to do and just say we are all different and this is just another variation

It would be like arguing against a BDSM theme for a party because we are taking from that sub culture without contributing anything 3 Cultures benefit from cultural appropriation it raises awareness and increases immersion in the native culture
2 Britain is a cultural melting pot appropriation goes both ways India started playing Cricket for example the person I was on the phone with raised the point that appropriation is particularly when something is taken from a culture without giving a contribution back to the culture from which it was taken which makes sense
However I would argue that the use of stereotypes in this way is not taking anything from the culture in the first place stereotypes only occasionally reflect current cultures often far removed from the circumstance of their use
This is the context of my post apparently this film culminates with a party in which people are invited to show up dressed as stereotypical elements of culture framed in an attempt to trap the students into going to a party founded on fundamentally racist ideals

1 Displaying stereotypes for any purpose ultimately does no harm causing offense or even in extreme cases devaluing the root culture is not the same as racism which is a prejudice against another person due to the colour of their skin there is no discrimination here other than bruised feelings no harm is done Stereotypes are used in comedy against pretty much every imaginable definable group
Now I can t imagine many people are foreign to party themes which now could be labelled as cultural appropriation the most common being Cowboys and Indians which are nowadays quick to be labelled as racist
Firstly I m a Brit so if I m missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies While having a conversation over the phone about a movie in which a black student at an Ivy league school started a radio station directed at White People during this conversation a couple of things came up such as how the black students disapproved of a house of only black students being changed in the future so that students would mix normally

Further backing my anecdotal evidence was the fact that the city I was living in during my job search built a new shopping mall and a new walmart

And a giant raptor like that that would listen is again a great soldier
Then Hoskins is killed by a raptor when trying to get the data on the project which seems to be an ironic he got what he was asking for
They use the raptors to hunt down the Indominus with the raptors obeying Owen until they find it and realize it s part raptor
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
The raptors proved how just four of them could decimate a group of highly skilled soldiers even when the soldiers knew what they were fighting against
The hero doesn t want to use the raptors and they obey him
But then Owen manages to get the raptors to follow him again in his fight against the Indominus at the end
But the raptors turning on the military was entirely based on the enemy being a giant raptor hybrid
Anywhere else in the world and the idea would have worked out great
They are great soldiers and the movie shows this repeatedly while vilifying the one wanting them to be soldiers
They took an intelligent creature and fed it with a crane never socializing it nor teaching it anything
And even after the raptors had turned on Owen they showed their loyalty by coming back to him and fighting to the death for him
The movie showed how much of a monster the creature was while pointing at the man who made it with military use in mind and blaming him for making it
The raptors then turn on the soldiers seemingly proving that they are too dangerous to use that way
Which again points to them being very loyal against anything other than a giant alpha raptor
In the movie Jurassic World Hoskins was the head of the park security who wanted to use the raptors for military purposes
But the park staff were the ones who messed that up
The movie tries to send a message that was stated in earlier Jurassic Park movies Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn t stop to think if they should
It was like an abused child who didn t know right from wrong because no one ever taught it
Yes it turned on the people and went on a rampage killing everything that moved
The military man who wants to use raptors to kill ironically gets killed by raptors
It was smart and fooled everyone to escape it s cage
edit As a side note even the Indominus wasn t a failure
If it had been raised with the care the raptors had it wouldn t have acted like that
He later becomes one of the movie s villains by inviting the military into the park in a coup d etat to control the situation

Children are highly vulnerable to suggestion

I believe that this alone is sufficient to damage the child regardless of whether the sexual relationship itself was damaging
Age of consent laws around the world vary dramatically and even within the US there is a wide range of things that are acceptable or unacceptable depending on what state you are in
I also believe that adults are capable of doing this to eachother in relationships where both people are of the consenting age
I do not believe that healthy sexual relationships occurring between adults and teens or children are given the proper room to breathe or prosper as soon as a child is discovered to be in a sexual relationship with an adult that child will be told repeatedly that their sexual partner is a bad person and that their sexual partner has abused them
But that s just the problem it s nothing more than an anecdote
Many people will tell you that a sexual relationship between an adult and a child who is X years old is unquestionably damaging to the child where X is usually a completely arbitrary number
Most people are in support of age of consent laws and will very aggressively assert that they want to protect the children
I don t see how this would have resulted in abuse or psychological damage
People who oppose my views also provide anecdotes
As an even bolder step I believe most age of consent laws are largely baseless as far as genuine evidence is concerned
I know that as a teenage boy especially by 14 I would have been excited to engage in a sexual relationship with an attractive female
I believe that more rigorous scientific investigation is necessary to justify the age of consent laws and that once the scientific evidence comes out the age of consent laws should be adjusted accordingly
Where things start to get shaky is the point when people start asserting that all sexual relationships are abusive once the victim is below a certain age
The amount of scientific research in this area is lacking and lots of the mania surrounding child abuse laws come from unproven ideas about child innocence and susceptibility to abuse
There is no doubt to me that an adult is capable of abusing a child in a relationship and that the adult is capable of abusing the child in a way that the child believes they are consenting and does not believe they are being abused

If we accept that the Koran is the primary source of all that is Islam and we accept that some individuals believe that the Koran is the unqestionable word of God and we accept that the Koran clearly calls for the murder of nonbelievers then it follows that we ve got a serious problem on our hands that will persist for as long as Islam remains

I highly doubt China would be as uncomfortable having a unified US influenced Korea on their doorstep like people say they d be
Furthermore they know they d have to go through sex trafficking and risk of death if they want to go through China
But my thinking may be entirely backwards
The longer we wait the more people will suffer and die
I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don t get all too frantic about the idea of war on the peninsula
We have two countries with very strong work ethics a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies another country with a ton of cheap labor lots of natural resources that would offset the costs and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula
China and South Korea are contrary to popular belief close allies
Some experts say a unified Korea can surpass Japan in economic power
I d like to see opposing arguments to this topic
I feel as if this conflict whether it is dormant or tense or whatever must be dealt with in the future and we re just kicking the can down the road
The reason why I am posting this is because I see others worrying a lot when seeing news of a potential resumption of war while I feel a sense of hope
Long term a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse

Again are we so limiting in our intelligence that we cannot find other avenues to fund the museum I wouldn t lie that it s amazing to watch the feat we can perform in the sky and the adrenaline rush that people crave but when it has costed lives and traumatized people living in that city it s one form of entertainment that we can totally live without
I can understand a show in a remote place where people consciously make the decision to take their kids and watch it
Hello folks As you may have seen footage of a disaster in Sussex during an airshow it made me think
Are we so limited in finding ways to entertain ourselves that we re okay to risk lives of the pilot and innocent children who are not adult to make the decision themselves People also bring the argument that the accidents like this are rare
A quick search on google tells me that such accidents happen every year
A brain freeze to a pilot and it s instant death depending where the plane might crash
I am fine with that although it makes me question the human race
Also I have heard arguments that airshows provide money to the museum
Again how can you live with your conscience that something that you support and feel entertained has killed people and brought grief in someone s family

The addition of a dedicated tongue scraper seems unnecessary and would only serve to add clutter and complexity to a task which is as simple as brushing your teeth

Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter I know I wouldn t be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn t pay attention
Walking a dog in public even on a leash is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm
There is also the problem of appropiate conviction
People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late
Sounds like a good compromise for me
So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security
This belongs in their responsibilty though
I really don t trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live
I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful I ll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how
The dog biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be especially in public spaces
To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this
In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially aggressive breeds of dogs and every dogs origin should be tested
However I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they re not scared of their dog I shouldn t be either
People would still avoid to be in shooting range
but also I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic
Anyway I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys
Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle
Here s my explanation Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog s behaviour
This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place
After reading this you probably think that either I ve been bitten by a dog or that I m a dog hating cat person
Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way This is because they ve made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin
I m no native speaker so please have mercy After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites
I have long been scared of all kinds of drugs except alcohol marijuana and legal prescription drugs
My thinking is mostly irrational so I would really like you guys to try to rationalize it for me
I do not like the idea of addictive drugs such as cocaine or heroin so my view will probably not be changed there
I would like to have my view changed as it is putting stress on my relationship
This causes me distress when people I know take them
Both evidence and personal experiences are welcome

I don t see this as a viable argument because if someone is going to leave then they have a reason to
Another reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years or possibly for the rest of their lives
Even if its a bad reason or a really good reason making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more
That means that marriage isn t as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want
I see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I assume that this is bound to be brought up so I will answer this first
And like I said in my first statement making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years
If someone leaves a marriage it means they are unhappy with it or have lost feelings for the other person
Before I begin I would like to point something out
Birds are meant to fly not to be caged and having a bird as a pet in a cage is incredibly selfish on your part
What is the allure of having a bird in a cage anyway It just sits there somtimes flies around it s little cage but on the whole it feels trapped
They are very low maitenance and very self reliant
If you re that lazy that 1 you want a pet but 2 you don t want to put very much effort into it get a cat
And unlike birds there are cats out there just begging to be rescued
Immortan Joe did not treat his wives as objects only for the purpose of bearing his children
The actresses who play his wives are all clean healthy and models in real life
In Mad Max Fury Road the director sets up Immortan Joe to be the ultimate villain devoid of humanity despite the fact that his actions shown in the movie prove he is not a terrible person but contains the purest and most positive versions of conservative political values
The quick pan of Immortan Joe s palace shows that there was a blackboard books a piano and private quarters for the wives
Immortan Joe never hurts any of his wives during the course of the movie or uses violence to do anything but protect his family and friends
Immortan Joe is accused of having Killed the world despite having saved it and reestablishing a stable human civilization
The wives write on the walls the reason they left was that they didn t want their sons to be warlords
In any other movie that would be admirable and make him the hero
Immortan Joe and the war boys become very upset about the death of the unborn fetus
In contrast many of the protagonist are only selfishly motivated
Nux becomes a good guy because he gives up his religion and becomes an atheist
This shows that he cared enough about them to provide for more than their basic needs to make him sons he wanted them to love him
That must have been incredibly difficult but he gets no praise for that only criticism
In the 2 days that they have been driving they have seen 5 places that can evidently support human life
Things That Will NOT Convince Me statements from the director cast or those involved in the production about their intentions any evidence from the extended universe this was a stand alone work with a self contained story and should be analyzed as such
They let Nux kill himself so they can escape even before the engine was torn out the plan did not look good for him
The appearance of the characters tells the audience what to think of them
The vuvulani had a source of fresh and their own farms and they messed it up but they don t get any blame
Max doesn t care about helping the wives escape he is only doing what is best for himself
EDIT PLEASE REFERENCE THE NUMBERS OF MY POINTS IT WILL CONVINCE ME MORE IF YOU REFUTE THESE OR SUGGEST THINGS THAT IMMORTAN JOE COULD HAVE DONE DURING THE TIMELINE OF THE MOVIE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE MORAL
Joe is covered in tumors and has a Darth Vader mask to look menacing and evil
There is also no evidence to suggest he raped them or has physically abused them as they have no bruises or scars except the grazed bullet wound from Max that they point out
Under the guise of an action movie George Miller has created a propaganda piece to unconsciously convince its audience of his political leanings
Despite water being a valuable resource needed to trade for guzzoline and for his farms Immortan Joe gives it away charitably to the vagrants on the outskirts of his society and advises them not to become dependent on he generosity
The group doesn t turn around to get the pregnant one who fell off and survived
The Vuvulani don t care about what is best for the people of the citadel they are only trying to put food in their own mouths
Immortan Joe created a society in the middle of a nuclear wasteland
But after realizing the green place didn t exist they decide its better to murder hundreds of people to take the citadel for themselves rather than to take 160 days to find a new place to live
Joe gives up significant strategic resources and strains relationships with his allies all in an attempt to get his wives and future child back
Max is treated as an object only kept around for his blood and constantly chained up or in a cage
With the 160 days it is very likely they would find another
Once again they are let off the hook for this bloodthirsty rampage because they are depicted as the protagonists
Recently though Romania has started to spend the budget more wisely by my reflex seems to have survived I simply cannot cope with the idea of paying the Government
That s why I formed this condition to consider paying taxes a stupid thing
I feel it s a waste of money
I ve been living in Romania and there have been almost 70 years since our Governments have been stealing our money and spent it on things which didn t concern our welfare but only the interests of an elite
I feel like there s a good reason why this is bad but can t really put my finger on it so my current stance is that it s okay as long as he s not forcing anyone and his actions don t cause any real harm
He paid this one guy 200 bucks to drink a cup of his pee which caused quite an uproar in the community
There s this Russian youtuber who s a grandson of a billionaire and he makes videos where he comes up to random people on the street and pays them to do different things like lick his shoe take their dress off in public and eat a bunch of ruble notes
Or even if someone cited tradition or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile
Therefore if your goal is to make yourself and or your family safer then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision
If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked then since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self defense
I do believe there is one exception to this
You or someone in your family are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self defense
I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self defense then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house
If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I m strictly speaking about what s the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety
For example if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby that could be worth the risk of gun ownership
If you have received threats on your life
If government or police forces have broken down
Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house
For example if you have a stalker
that lays out some criticisms of the first article s source study along with a rebuttal from another journalist who s written on the topic
So for the average person the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun
But we do know statistically on average that is not the case
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Basically if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house then it would be rational to have a gun
My view is that I believe in incestual relationships and I m going to give a few reasons why The reason behind my post is the recent legalization of homosexual marriage in all of the US
Feel free to change my view and let mine embrace you
So if you apply the same logic incestual relationships should be legalized as long as the couple involved are of legal age of consent but many will disagree because of the fact that the offspring of the incest couple will be more likely to be disabled however it s not illegal to have babies if you have illnesses such as Huntingtons
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
To expand think of marriage and sex it s between two people that are willing to give consent so gay marriage fits these guidelines and therefore was legalized

Media When it comes to media East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds
Availability European languages have more speakers than East Asian languages but most Europeans already speak English
Travel It s easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English
Learning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages
I don t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through other than tourist spots catering to English speakers
If you disclude writing systems East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither
If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one
Most Europeans at the very least speak basic English and most East Asians only know English words
Cultural benefits It s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours
Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture
For an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world
A lot of European language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be whereas East Asian grammar often is logical and straight to the point
You can travel across Europe only knowing English but in East Asia it helps more to know the language
Going through their music films television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west
Specifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of and as a means produce a lot more films music games comics literature and TV than any European or South American country
However learning Mandarin Chinese Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language
European cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world
Chinese characters hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki
East Asian languages might not be as widely available but their populations are educated travel a lot and have Difficulty East Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier

What could possibly go through someone s mind thinking that this is a normal thing to do Every time I see someone starting one of those threads I automatically assume they are socially awkward and don t spend time with people
Odds are you will have someone using your phone at some point
Maybe a friend s phone died and they need to borrow yours
Guys posting their cool new lockscreen or wallpaper of some half naked chick and it simply amazes
Maybe you re asking a stranger to take a picture
I see a bunch of these posts on Reddit
Maybe your mom needs it for a second for whatever reason
The planet we inhabit is far behind our singular greedy goal of accumulating power and wealth
It doesn t matter what happens the victims will either always remain the same or switch out destruction will always reign supreme and fear and ignorance will always lead to one man killing another for his resources rather than working together to cultivate them
Because of the way the natural world works destruction ignorance and evil will always win
Basically I was looking at some YouTube videos from different places doing some research on the internet reading political polls scientific polls and reading about history and psychology when I finally reached a conclusion
Next nearly three years ago now young children all went to enjoy just a comfortable day at school they went to spend time with their friends learn and go home and tell their parents all about it
I implore you to change my bleak views because honestly on a dying planet as a member of a species that has begun to pride itself on ignorance where things like race and sexual orientation matter more than survival and cooperation where a group of friends can spend weeks orchestrating a magnificent picnic only for a maniac with a gun to decide their lives don t matter ending it instantly I don t know what else to think other than that evil has such a massive advantage over good and will always come out on top
Basically nothing really matters this world and especially mankind are hopeless and despite our best efforts out struggles are ultimately sadly but surely futile
Honestly in this world how could goodness creation and knowledge possibly win How could creation and life win if destruction and death is so much easier How could knowledge and wisdom win if fear always drags people to ignorance How could good win when the core of a human is entirely selfish My view is simply this the world will not change for it cannot change
Why do I say evil and destruction are predetermined to win One simple fact destruction is just so much easier than creation
In our modern world billions of years of evolution and biodiversity are being destroyed because the human race needs more and more
In response our country then killed millions of their people
Billions of years of biodiversity all destroyed within 500 years of industrialization
Let me start out by saying philosophically I m a cynic fatalist and an existential nihilist
Love care money billions of years of evolution all of it ended when one day a deranged man decided the best way to make a point was to go to that school and end the lives of those innocent children and the teachers that watched over them
Look at the Twin Towers they took decades to build had hundreds of construction workers planners managers and businessmen that went into building them
Hundreds of workers decades and thousands of lives all of that torn down because one day a couple hijackers with an airplane decided they wanted to hurt our country
Upon completion they housed thousands of workers and was a center for economics
And then rather than accept the hard truths most humans would rather listen to the politicians that would happily stick a knife into their back
Parental failure to provide their children with adequate treatment for a chronic illness is a well accepted reason for a child protection registration for neglect
It is absolutely essential to keep a child at a normal weight
I believe that childhood obesity become a child protection concern when parents behave in a way that actively promotes treatment failure in a child who is at serious risk from their weight and when the parents or carers understand what is required
Allowing your kids to develop a condition such as obesity which leads to severe cardiovascular damage on all levels and a shortened life could be seen as bad parenting
Parents in this day and age should have advice and information on what healthy eating actually is
Even though others may point out the existence of factors such as the marketing of unhealthy foods the primary responsibility falls on the parents every time
But until proven being a shadow of a doubt should you not be detained in a location that is more humane and safe At the very least your on room with privacy and no danger
This question focuses on the US justice system though it seems to be prevalent in all countries I know
In short how is it moral to treat people like criminals before their conviction I do understand that if an arrest is made it is sensible that that person be detained
Is this simply not a practical Would it just cost too much _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Essentially by virtue of the law you are innocent until proven guilty
Therefore how is it fair or sensible that you can be arrested and put in jail with potentially other violent criminals and treated like one yourself without being convicted No proof has been presented to incarcerate you
So basically I m not meeting girls on a frequent basis and I m not really sure how to do it doesn t include drinking in some way or another
I don t consider myself socially awkward in the least but I am often quiet and have had a couple girls I know tell me I am aloof and reserved
During the work week I don t socialize much just because I don t have much time to
When I socialize on the weekends I usually bro out and go grab a few drinks with a couple of my buddies although I do often get invited to large gatherings parties and my friends almost always let me know if there s a big gathering happening
Sometimes I try to imagine what life would be like if I never get into another relationship to prepare myself for that possibility
I m not interested in online dating either so I don t really have a lot of options which is why I m considering giving up
I am 23 and have only had one actual girlfriend before but I had 5 or 6 sexual partners in college off the top of my head
Several girls I ve been with have told me that I could get any girl I want based on my looks and intelligence but instead of making me cocky it hasn t done anything to improve my lack of confidence
There are very slim pickings at my work for potential dates and I don t believe I m going to find the love of my life in one of the dive bars near my house so I am not meeting a lot of girls that interest me with my current lifestyle
I did well with the college hookup scene but am clueless when it comes to post grad socializing
I have a quick temper but I m good at controlling it
I believe in a non biased environment a course covering religion is an extremely important subject to learn
In addition with the ease of mass communication that we have now religions are becoming much more mixed in certain areas
Regardless of individual beliefs religion has played a massive influence on art culture conflict and civilization as a whole
but this is more focusing on the concept instead of the logistics
I unfortunately won t be able to reply for most of the day but I am getting some information that I haven t thought of
Edit Thanks for all the great responses everyone As I mentioned before this is more of a hypothetical scenario rather than a realistic one as clearly required courses and time varies a lot depending on region
I would first like to clarify that I am aware that some countries do this laws are different some places like the Bible Belt would likely use it to push a single ideology etc
It is often the case that people do to their environment have certain incorrect presumptions about different faiths that are never discussed
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I believe a course would help people understand more of other faiths and perhaps cause them to question their own or consider others

Right now I think the laws we have are fair there s no women can t show their breasts statute there are public decency laws
From an ethical point of view the FTN campaign beliefs are too simplistic they don t go into the real ethics behind the issue
If we take the simplistic approach that the FTP movement does men and women should be treated exactly the same woman wear G strings on the beach then men can wear G Strings on the beach if men wore G strings their testicles would show try telling the mothers that their kids have to exposed to deez nuts to have an equal society bullshit
I think public decency laws are extremely fair they generally aren t specific they let the society choose what is indecent and what isn t I think the greater society should choose
I believe that people should have the right not to be exposed with in reason to sexual content in public
Let s take the golden approach try find absurdities You wouldn t want a man or woman to flash their respective vagina penis a you or your kids I think shown breasts are as sexually thought of as a vagina
If a man flashes his penis at someone it s quite fairly considered sexual assault
If breasts weren t sexualised as much as they are in our society the laws we have now wouldn t prosecute free nipples
Although in most instances I believe the We shouldn t focus on this issue because there are bigger issues argument is wrong we really should be tackling real gender inequality where there are actual principles being violated like the pay gap and female under representation in government
The movement s aim is to increase gender equality by ignoring our differences and allowing woman to show body parts everyone one in OUR society acknowledges as sexual
The human race is advanced enough to be able to acknowledge and celebrate our differences and create laws that address the real nature of things as a society I believe we can have true equality and acknowledge we are all different
I believe supporters of the Free the Nipple campaign are miss guided
But if we allow one group to show sexual parts of their body which most people don t want to be exposed to without consent are we more equal Or less Would men be able to show their testicles under FTN s reasoning If women can show their sexual parts that people don t wanna see can men show their sexual parts that people don t wanna see
FTN looks at the issue like this Men are allowed to show their chest to be equal women need to be allowed show their chest
We should accept our differences and create deeper laws that fit all with true equality
How many people waste time each day typing out 10 emails instead of creating a group that automatically sends it out to a predefined list How many people even use email filters Given that the average person spends a few hrs per day going through email I think teaching the less tech savvy some shortcuts could realistically allow them to do in 2
Simple computer skills that could be taught in a three day seminar and easily save millions of people 30 minutes a day are not being taught
Why aren t we paying people to learn computer science Or nursing Let s say it costs the government 100k to finance the degree
This efficiency will continue to pay dividends throughout that person s working life
While relative skills determine the proportion of the pie you receive it has no bearing on the total size of the pie
The most important determinant of a country s standard of living is productivity
What s the ROI on that Well if they can spend 30 min less per day going through email b c they know how to do some advanced queries filter incoming emails and automatically assign labels depending on who that email is from that is their wage x money saved
If their wage is 10 hr that generates an ROI in the first year alone
Instead we are asking workers who may already be overworked to spend money and time doing something they may not even be sure has value
If they have a 30 yr career in this field they will add 600k to the economy over the course of their career
Since I ve so commonly gotten this response I want to dispel the notion that wealth is determined by relative skills and represents some finite pie to be divided in different ways wealth is not a zero sum proposition
What if we pay these workers to get basic computer certifications or at least cover their tuition costs Let s say we pay these workers 1 000 for a week long course on some basic computer literacy
Therefore if more people were highly educated a highly educated worker may not receive high wages relative to the average citizen but those wages would buy significantly more because the workforce would be hugely more productive and efficient
Let s say it would have taken 5 yrs for this person to learn these basic habits on their own we will have increased productivity by 7 500 in that time by intervening and paying them to learn to be more productive
That s an easy investment to make and a noble one educating and empowering the people through education
5 hrs what they previously did in 3 hrs
Let s start with the low hanging fruit
I think the easiest way to increase productivity is to help computer illiterate people
This basic logic applies to areas where there are shortages of workers

EDIT Of the five colleges I applied to I was rejected by two of them but was accepted by three of them
This is a person s future which they are dealing with
This might seem like a personal argument but the fact remains that I m sure many students would agree with me
I understand including algebra and geometry but I don t see why they include trigonometry
It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section
I understand that my scores in reading and writing were average but it was the low math score which really hurt my chances of admission
Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions and do not require students to take a trigonometry course
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Some will argue that it makes sure students are well rounded but it s incredibly unfair to use this to test a student s aptitude for college
Because of this I was denied admission to many colleges which I applied to
When I was in high school I had an 89 overall GPA
I got mid range scores on the reading and writing sections of the SAT but did very poorly on the math section
I m perfectly happy to have a beer with anyone who wants to chill
While that sort of secular thought is sometimes commendable I don t think this particular kind of law is that bad and it even has some benefits
The fact is even though I consider myself very liberal in what kinds of substances people should be allowed to consume I recognize that many of them even used properly in moderation have consequences for health in the long term
So I don t see this as any serious infringement of personal freedom
Alcohol will do a number on your liver so you probably shouldn t drink it everyday

Therefore if they re opposed towards any sort theoretically motivated law they think it should be repealed
So I don t think there is anything wrong with listening to your own music or dancing to it or acknowledging that you like it any more than acknowledging that you like your sandwich you made
You might re work your sandwich to build a sandwich that you really like
If they don t like something they change it or re work it
Their guide for what they decide what to do is whether or not they like it
However when an artist creates music what they are doing is just creating exactly what they want to hear
You create music you want to listen to based on your taste in music
Of course hearing interesting ideas that you would never think of in a million years is also cool
Like they are so in love with themselves
It s like making a sandwich
So when an artist creates music it makes perfect sense that it would be music they would really enjoy listening to
Just because you make a sandwich you like it doesn t mean nobody else can make sandwiches you like but it also doesn t mean you are vain and in love with yourself if you love eating the sandwiches you learned to make
But anyways CMV _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
It s not like you re in love with yourself because you made a sandwich you really like
I often come across people that react to an artist listening to and really being into their own music as being a vain person
And on top of that they are your honest idea of exactly the type of thing you want to hear or feel that s why you chose to play it
But eating your sandwich and enjoying it isn t vain
You choose the condiments and cuts of meat or whatever knowing how it s going to taste
It s like that with music
Especially during improvisation because the ideas you are coming up with are often nearly as much of a surprise for you as they are for everyone else it s just you thought of it a fraction of a second earlier than other people heard it
When you make a sandwich you make it with all the ingredients you want it to have

If a mugger comes for an unarmed man the risk is the guy yelling or maybe trying to punch you vs
Fighting the entire population of a country instead of just the army is a daunting proposition and a significant deterrent to would be invaders
The US obviously doesn t have to worry about that but there s a reason no one ever messes with the Swiss
If she has a gun and her attacker does not she has a tremendous advantage
If the citizens are armed the state is much more limited in what they can do
Put simply guns empower the weak and put them on even terms with the strong
Finally anyone who responds saying Lol what s a rifle going to do against an M1 Abrams really needs to google the words guerrilla or Afghanistan
I also think it is a useful check on the ultimate power of the State
I m having a lot of fun with this and hearing a lot of solid arguments though Lord knows my karma is taking a hit
If he has a gun it tips the scale way way over to the risk side
If the attacker does as well they are evenly matched at worst
Nobody is happy with the US government but they could never descend to the level of actual tyranny before we overthrew them
Also guns are a tremendous equalizer
This is also true for the elderly and any man of below average fighting prowess
In countries with strict gun control the government can push their people much farther before facing serious retribution
I am trying to respond to everybody so please be patient
Also an armed citizenry makes your country much more formidable in a war
Significantly better odds than giving away all your stuff and placing your faith in human decency
After all when seconds count the Police are only minutes away
It tips the power balance strongly in favor of the government
In other situations calling the cops
Not everyone has to be worried about this but it is a factor
It is simply an indisputable fact that mass ownership of guns is power to the people
A gun doesn t even have to be fired to defuse a situation
A valid perspective I suppose though not one very compatible with democracy
Edit Hey guys I have to go take care of an errand but I should be back in two hours or so
I think guns are also a useful check on the government s power
Now you may argue that the people are stupid and can t be trusted with that power
There s a big difference between people throwing bricks at jack booted thugs and shooting bullets

To elaborate when you are under attack the single best tool you can have is a gun

We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
The fact that we as humans hold dominion over all other earthly creatures necessitates the notion of a responsibility we have in keeping balance and order to the food chain considering that humans are the top of it
First what I refer to as hunting is the killing or trapping of any animal with the purpose of doing so as sport whether it be to eat them as food or keep them as trophies
Killing for sport is something one could argue not inherent only in humans but we ve taken it beyond what it means if an animal were to kill another animal for sport just by sheer organization
In regards to the act of hunting and then using prey as food I would argue that in our modern society this is completely unnecesary given the obvious institutions in place all ready i
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I m speaking of our current gaming rules and regulations in place meant to keep this balance one would want to believe but a system well beyond anything an animal killing another animal for sport could come up with for obvious reasons
Why view other animals any different in that regard Admittedly the quandary I have with my argument is that I feel it should be banned all over the world
This definition recognizes that at one point there was a reason at some point in history for its existence however
Lastly I say it is antiquated but that is a reflection of my opinion based on the notion that hunting was a means of surviving which is no longer necessary in our current society
I argue though that it was carried out by an American one who believed in the sport of hunting who willingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to do it and that had he come from a society that looked down on the sport he might not have had such determination to carry out what he did
By doing this I m brought back to the senseless killing of Cecil the lion which was done in a different country
And as the story of Cecil the lion illustrates the system governing wildlife from being hunted and killed is flawed to say the least
Recently we ve seen the story of Cecil the lion become big news across the country and in the world at large
I am not talking about the regulated hunting of threatening species or the killing of animals in situations where they pose significant danger
However due to the problems and beliefs of other societies around the world some of which being so underdeveloped that hunting game is a valuable source of income I have to limit my banning to the United States alone
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
The bottom line may be that hunting exists because we as humans enjoy it it is thrilling to us but should that condone its existence We condemn the murder of humans
What i see is that while for men sex is a need like hunger and all for women it s more of a take it or leave it thing something they can enjoy but that they don t really need a nice thing to have but that doesn t really matter much if they don t have it like say chocolate
First of all i do not like to believe this because i ve been told over and over and over that it isn t true but i keep seeing more and more evidence of it as the years pass and second i m speaking of average people here i know there s asexuals and sex addicts but those are the outliers not the common case

We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
If I do I obviously understand the need to wash them but that is not the typical case
Don t get me wrong I usually do wash my hands after using the restroom
Perhaps I may touch the bathroom stall door but I really don t think it s so disgusting as to warrant hand washing
If I wash my hands every time I pee they get really dry but I have to do it anyways in public restrooms because of societal conventions whatnot
But goddamn my hands are so dry right now
I wipe myself with toilet paper and very rarely do I actually touch anything with my hands other than toilet paper
However I drink a lot of water and go to the bathroom more often than I think I should wash my hands
I also see the overall societal benefit pretending you should wash your hands after going to the bathroom
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
But I do it not because going to the bathroom is inherently dirty but rather because my hands are dirty
So I see going to the bathroom as a kind of natural reminder that perhaps I should wash my hands soon
Some toilets with shorter handles do have to be touched but usually those are personal toilets in my house that I know are clean
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
After I use the toilet most of the time the flushing is done either automatically or with a long handle that I touch with my foot
And no this isn t something I think about all the time
As a woman I don t really get my hands dirty when I pee
I know this is a dumb topic and it isn t real a big deal in my life
I think it s important to wash your hands after touching everything once every few hours
It is noteworthy that the dominant philosophical trends of the time were phenomenology and existentialism which were attempts to find a fundamental ground for consciousness in a newly modern world whose science had demoted God from his throne but neglected to nominate a new Fundamental Arbiter in replacement
If all value is arbitrary can we value anything Is creation valuable Life itself This brings us the 2nd objection It s just colors abstract
But why do we want art to require technical skill or effort The answer seems to me that it makes worth quantifiable in terms of man hours spent or technical skills applied we assign worth to goods with money and we earn certain amounts of money based on the time we work at a particular job
That feels simple but actually we know when we think about it that even the apparently firm valuation possible with money is linked to arbitrary process the economic status of the country which issues it political contingencies and emergencies the variability of market prices for goods and services etc
Beauty becomes something that is not necessarily inherent in a particular nude figure painted with particular colors and brush strokes if it is even something to be strived after at all
No effort technical skill is required to create it I don t get it it s just colors It s not pretty beautiful Please let me know of any others you can think of But to address these I ve listed First No effort is required to create it
I don t care how you do it but I want to be feeling deep existential dread at the way I ve wasted years of my life on a total void by the time I wake up tomorrow morning Have at it
Yes in many cases very little traditional technical skill is necessary to create any number of famous pieces of the last century
Perhaps some of you will appreciate these artists as much as I do and perhaps others of you will gain new fodder for the pointed attacks against my favorable stance towards modern art that I am hoping for I love which as portions constantly blink on and off modulate to new ambiguities the ambiguity already present in each phrase demonstrate a freedom of creation bound to the realm of play opened by the identification of the artist with his social role
That doesn t mean many of their works are not beautiful however the simplicity and poetic elegance of Hans Haacke s would I argue meet many updated standards of beauty a simple transparent figure which manifests changes in the heat and pressure of the room it is within it providing a sort of spiritual residue of the minds and bodies which perceive and surround it
And by the same token often very little quantifiable time or physical effort would have been necessary to create the same pieces
When we acknowledge that all processes of valuation are at bottom arbitrary we are liberated from the requirement to adhere to traditional systems of valuation but also forced to confront the problem of using any system of valuation at all
For Rothko his paintings represented man s transcendental relationship with his own consciousness a kind of pure experiential expression of pure Being
OK so that s enough theorizing from me change my view Make me realize that modern art is worthless
And of course while there actually is a great deal of technical canvas and paint ability which goes into Rothko s works traditional figurative techniques are abandoned in them
So here s what I see as the commonly raised objections to the value of modern and contemporary art
Thought I would flip the usual Modern art isn t real art stance around and present a muscular defense of the various radical branches of 20th and 21st century art
So while Rothko does not use traditional figurative techniques his work is effortful in the sense that it tries to express a new sense of modern spirituality without God
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Similar insights to these are driving factors in the way the artwork of the 20th century moved gradually away from traditional technical representation of subject matter
Duchamp s Fountain among much of his other work was a fairly direct critique of traditional concepts of artistic beauty and later Conceptual artists would work with ideas which were in many cases almost totally devoid of physical manifestation or any object with which to invest with traditional beauty
So those are my initial defenses against some of the more common critiques of modern art please do your best to pick them apart as well as point out other points that I ve missed
A common whipping boy for Reddit s typical reaction against modern art is Mark Rothko whose monumental color blocks are often presented as a sort of Emperor s New Clothes
But we must take note the effort Rothko is putting into his work is not technical effort but rather effort towards discovering a system of valuation which he can stand on and for after he has abandoned traditional systems
Come at me with all you ve got about the poverty of modern art I m going to start with a rebuttal of some of the common points raised against the worth of modern art and then list some of the artists I like and why I like them
And time itself is subject to the same instability it zips by when we re having fun and drags endlessly when we re working on a tedious task
And finally number 3 It s not beautiful it s ugly This point obviously is answered to some degree by the points I ve previously made in dismissing traditional techniques traditional standards are also held up to question
In any case the gist of my rebuttal to this last point is that just as artistic techniques had to shift fundamentally to address our experience of living in the modern age so did standards of beauty and even the valuation of beauty itself
Variations of the same can be said for much of the various avant gardes of the first half of the 20th century traditional artistic valuation was being abandoned but the search for a new ground from and of which to create art was a consuming occupation
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Take your best shot But now that I ve put up a defense I m going to launch a little offense examples of some of my favorite artists of the last century all having worked at some points at least in very untraditional mediums

As a software engineer I always say there are two kinds of problems everything can fall into and besolved 1
Reddit is Lisp Python wheras Voat is C
Completely different languages database structures etc
for example 1 Click make it that you need to click once to order a product online using your previously entered information
sort a deck of cards 99
9999 of all software engineering work falls into the latter most things that you try to accomplish and solve tend to be easily explained and solved by any person not in the field and for people in the field it is OBVIOUS Even more sophisticated things such as predicting what other users would like is obvious to anyone in the machine learning field
Any software engineer will tell you that this could be completed in a few hours and they already have 99 of the design So you ask how do I protect my software from being copied simple you copyright it
However if reddit as a site was patentable Voat would never exist even though it s an independently coded and created product
A good example is Voat vs Reddit AFAIK voat is open source reddit is not

Higher criminality of men is well known

Some reports have found that 95 of refugee women have been raped https books
Women and girls are harmed far worse in the conflicts and in the refugee camps than men and boys are
From a cost perspective it would be easier and faster to automatically deport all men
The receiving countries suffer from the violence and criminality of those refugees who fail to integrate and lastly having clear lines on who can enter and can not does not create false hope and unnecessary deaths
Since women commit next to no sex and violent crime especially in patriarchal cultures this would relieve some of the fears of the native populations

Why do they do this I mean psychologically students will behave the way they are treated
I have spent a year in Sweden
In Sweden you choose between programs instead of classes
Teachers never tell you to be quiet or to put your phone away
The schools have more of a you re the one fucking up if you don t do things right kind of attitude
Not to mention that swedes get paid around 100 a month to go to school and during breaks you can leave the school and come back for your next class
In my case there were fewer classes than in the US
If they are treated like children they will behave accordingly but if they are given more freedom and a shit ton more responsibility they will realize that they are adults and should behave like it or they will fail completely
First of all they can dress guerre m however they want and also students call them by their first name
Maybe Monday I had two hours of math and then a two hour break then lunch then science then that was it for that day
For the most part it works pretty well
There s a natural science program a medical program an art program technological ect
Then here in the US teachers treat students like children
High school is three years and it s called gymnasium
I only had around 5 classes and we didn t have them everyday
They yell they tell us to shut up they tell us to put our phones away
As you can probably imagine high school is much different there
And you don t have to ask the teacher you just leave as you need
Also you have unlimited bathroom breaks
What I liked the most about school in Sweden was the teacher student relation
These posts usually get tons of thumbs up
But really can it be that big a deal that everyone so strongly agrees on this issue whenever someone brings it up What makes the techless lifestyle so superior Sometimes shit happens and you wanna have proof when it does
I have trouble even determining what that means which is probably my biggest problem here
Firstly I don t think there s as big a detriment as people seem to imply with recording something
I remember it showing up on John Watson s blog from Sherlock where apparently Sherlock from Sherlock said that he wishes people would experience life instead of recording it

I don t take a lot of videos or pictures either so I guess that makes me unable to have any personal experience with how it might stop me from experiencing life
But it s obviously something that shows up commonly in other places
It just seems like it s easy for me to think of all the pros of recording things and it s difficult for me to think of cons
There s this shame that comes with taking lots of pictures and videos apparently because it damages your ability to experience life
A very very popular opinion I see stated such as on a video of Obama addressing the LGBT community I saw recently is that people should put down their phones and cameras so they can actually experience life instead of just watching it
With the Obama video I thought that at the very least was out of place simply because that was Obama speaking it s only natural that many people would record it because you can actually make money off of selling that footage if you have the best quality and angle
Doesn t sound too much like our detective who sits in a chair most of his time but according to John Watson he totally definitely said that

And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country
The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed targeted as a black only issue
The American consciousness does not change overnight
We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying nigga and bitch like it s a pronoun
5 I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype
Homophobia Racism Misogyny As I stated earlier the black community hasn t made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip hop culture perpetuates
Sports athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty
There is very little initiative towards the Arts STEM etc
You are less likely to find the token black guy and more likely to find the reformed thug
However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the black community
Even TV shows portray this everything from sitcoms to drama
Now I understand that hustlin can translate into any race culture as just another medium in which to get money
Quiet the opposite but it is the black community that has embraced the hip hop scene and made the world associate it with us amp crime street life
I believe you can t have your cake and eat it too
I also understand that my experiences do not relate to all of the black community
Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people

Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by for the black community
Again creating polarizing opinions slogans like All Lives Matter Black nationalism In my eyes black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths
By that I mean just because I was able to make it out of the hood doesn t necessarily mean every black person is awarded that opportunity
We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises but we also want black only things

Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation

We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Hip hop is attached to black culture and it seems that black culture cannot distance itself from hip hop
I believe that the black community is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma
The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime yet it sees police brutality as more important
The 15 females will also be the tough smart women that can hold their own
The Anti War Argument People won t want their daughters dying overseas
The US military is currently about 15 female
The Equality Argument Women are included in the burden playing a role proportionate to the military s current demographics
Note that the US military is beginning the formal inclusion of women in most combat roles
The Excellence Argument With women in the draft the 85 that are male can be selected more rigorously
An influx of 50 50 genders would cause logistics issues on ships in barracks and in the culture
Women have proved capable in a variety of combat and leadership roles in militaries around the world and the SJW generation could offer up a few fierce warriors
Knowing that a draft will include all young Americans will make our beautiful nation less quick to jump into foreign quagmires
The draft should keep in line with the amount of women currently in service
Some will likely remain closed and others like artillery and machinegunning will require physical standards that will deter most women

In this situation these people would still occasionally venture to other subs with their opinions and would get destroyed by the logic of more rational posters
It s the equivalent to the I allow my teens to have their friends over and drink here because otherwise they would find someplace else where I can t maintain control and it would be worse
The reason that banning and quarantines subs like coon town and fph is a bad idea is because before the subscribers to those subs came to reddit to discuss their hateful viewpoints
I m curious to see if anyone can CMV on this one as I ve thought about it quite a bit and can t seem to find any reason for banning them that s good enough to justify the consequences
My logic is this reddit is a place on the Web for discussion and subreddits are designed for discussion of particular topics viewpoints even hateful ones
As much as we don t like to see it every once in awhile on reddit it s a much worse idea to ban these subs from here and have them go somewhere where there is no chance of change
This doesn t allow them any outside discussion or inflection on their opinions and therefore they end up festering in that community and getting even worse
When faced with irrefutable facts some people do end up changing
My guess is that more than one of these people probably changed their viewpoint because of these discussions
Now that they have been driven off reddit they will go back to their isolated hateful communities on dedicated websites forums
In spite of its apparent wealth the US is still a country where if you don t work or are fired you suddenly are at risk of premature death from starvation
Unfortunately short of micromanaging every element of upbringing it is Equality of outcome is the third possibility
This is the easiest thing but unfortunately it has a bad habit of leading to revolutions for two reasons 1 People get jealous when there is inequality
There are three main ways for a society to handle inequality Don t promote equality at all
While pure equality of outcome only works on paper pure equality of opportunity where there are no outer limits on inequality is pretty darn bad too
If there is still a percent of the population who cannot guarantee that their basic needs are met there is a high risk of them turning to theft or violence
The book The Spirit Level touches on this
It is commonly associated with Soviet totalitarianism but in its more modest form it predominates in countries like Canada France and Sweden and has excellent results Sweden for instance has more billionaires per capita than the US and as good if not better of a quality of life for its average citizens

The biggest consequence of mass immigration within Europe has been an increase in xenophobia and ethnic tensions
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
info economist consensus The consensus opinion on the economics of immigration is that unlimited migration would double world GDP and therefore be good
Except for Germany most countries are growing nowhere near fast enough to absorb new intra European immigrants much less realize the double digit expected GDP gains
These problems are magnified times 100 with non European immigrants who often turn ti rioting or religious extremism and Who are fracturing social solidarity in northern Europe
What should I do I feel bad and terrible and evil but I can t help it it s the only group that I m prejudiced against
If people want to be integrated in society they need to minimally adapt to cultural norms
Of course people don t hire Gypsies no one wants to risk hiring someone who at the slightest disagreement and beef with you can call an entire family to kick your ass
It s hard to not be racist against these people when everytime I see one of them on the street they will either beg and try to pickpocket you or try to sell illegal products and if you re lucky they won t threat you with a knife to handle the money
And don t even get me started on Gypsy neighborhoods ghettos and places where they live it s impossible to go in there without goods and leave in one piece those are literally no go zones in my country and the police goes in there with a group of fully armored cops with MP5 s
They complain about discrimination but they have no problem starting a fight with you for no reason and if you dare fighting back be 100 sure that they will call the entire family to kick your ass and possibly put you in a coma
Oh and if it s relevant I was robbed by a group of 10 Gypsies when I was younger I didn t lose valuable goods but it affected me deeply
In every country in Europe you have groups of people who are marginalized profiled and suffer discrimination Gypsies are frequently included on the list
You are all thinking that I m terribly racist but this is the only ethnic group I have a beef with I don t have problems with Africans who are a very discriminated group in my country as well In fact my girlfriend is half Gypsy and I love her very much but she was adopted and raised by a non Gypsy family and so she doesn t have the culture in her And trust me if you think I m racist you ll be surprised to know she hates Gypsies with a passion that isn t even comparable to what I m exposing here
They always complain about how racist society is against them yet they don t allow their kids to go to mandatory school years and basically force them to work for cultural reasons
And why is that It s not because they have darker skin color in fact I d argue Gypsies are ethnically a diverse group with sub ethnic group It s because of their culture
Oh and obviously not speaking native tongues with a proper accent and lacking basic education because your parents voluntarily choose to deprive you of it also doesn t help
EDIT Some people are having problems with me using the word racist to describe myself I think it is accurate because not all racism is supremacy and there s subtle and institutional racism but if you don t agree with the use of the word you can still address my prejudice because the word used to describe it is not that important what s important is how I feel about this group of people
I am racist against gypsies There I said it
When I say I m racist I don t mean that I think they re an inferior group of people or that they should be exterminated and kicked out of my country it s just that I can t stand them
This solves the problem of a classic utopia where social progress is stagnant by not enforcing a common social contract
If deception were literally impossible then laws would not be required

By contrast a Negative Income tax has the main advantage of a Basic Income over current welfare systems simplicity b makes work pay rather than withdrawing welfare at not sensible rates without any of the disadvantages of the Basic Income system not spending most of the additional welfare to the middle class and rich b being affordable on the public purse c doesn t blunt work incentives and d doesn t risk wage spiral inflation
The only calculations of a Basic Income that I have seen all seem to make the following things that I perceive as errors Sets the level of Basic Income at a level too low to live in which case what s the point Sets the level of Basic Income too high in which case it is unaffordable and why would anyone work Sets the level of Basic Income at a level that is possible to live and that is not to high but involves replacing pretty much all public services in which case how is this better in any way Involves giving a lot of money to people to rich to get any welfare at all at the moment rather than people really need it in which case how is this a sensible use of public funds And if you taper the Basic Income off as people earn more then it is not a Basic Income
I believe they are unnecessary because it is changing something that never really was wrong in the first place
Anyway this is sort of a ridiculous CMV but if anyone had any idea to CMV than that would be cool and maybe I wouldn t have such ideas about people that get fake tans
As for spray tans they are just aesthetically gross to me they often are streaky unnatural and way too dark or orange
I think the biggest issue I have with it is the fact that tanning beds are harmful I mean you can get skin cancer
Its just whats the point _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Ok so this might be a preference thing but I think fake tans are unnecessary and unattractive
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I would imagine those that get fake tans do so in order to change what they believe to be an ugly or inadequate self perception
For me at least I do not care how pale or tan you are sure it can look nice if you are bronzed coming from the beach but I do not expect that
I d like to make the following comparison gangsta rap
Fast forward almost 30 years later and we have Donald Trump running for president
In the wake of Donald Trump rising in the polls I would agree that he has done so by being unapologetic about his views and opinions and that he has proven that we have taken political correctness too far
To me this isn t about political correctness and more about politicians lying
So I ve seen a lot of posts on PC ness lately and I d thought I d give my own angle to this
However it is my view that they were trying to be as honest as they can and that they did their best to show the lifestyles and attitudes associated with street life
Sure I do not condone advocating violence against the police but as far as I m concerned they were not blatantly lying making up their own facts or making any sweeping claims in their songs nor did they ever intend to as part of my argument
Yes I could say he s being almost as politcally incorrect as gangsta rappers were but the big difference is his dishonesty in his rhetoric
He s making up his own facts and making false sweeping claims that only happen to be politically incorrect when it s his lies that are the real problem
He is lying about Mexican immigrants in saying that the vast majority are rapists bringing crime and bringing drugs
Now I haven t seen the Straight Outta Compton movie but I have listened to guys like NWA and I very well know how controversial and politically incorrect their lyrics are
Tl DR My view is that you are entitled to your opinions as politically incorrect as they may be but not your own facts
And that is my problem with Donald Trump
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
However I think framing it like that is missing the point

Furthermore I m skeptical of an arms race since Israel and Pakistan already have nukes and this has not caused one
ally and has no nuclear infrastructure which apparently takes a long time to create
I agree that it will be an inconvenience and complication and a negative for Western interests but it will not be a disaster
Iran obtaining nukes may actually encourage internal liberalization reform
engaged in such conflicts but kept nukes to themselves
Besides while they are happy to sponsor terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas they would have no interest giving away a superweapon to an unpredictable third party
Hardliners use the threat of invasion to scare people away from reforms so their position would be weakened by having a bomb
However their strategy seems similar to Nixon s act like you re crazy to get more out of negotiations
Iran would not use a nuke because that would be absolute suicide
Iranian leadership is not rational and will do it anyway
However Saudi Arabia is both a U
Iran will give nuclear material to terrorists This would still be suicide
A nuke provides ultimate protection from invasion
Iranian leadership has shown itself to be very rational
However this is hardly different from the status quo where it is common knowledge that there is little public appetite for an assault on Iran s borders
Yes it uses terrible rhetoric and incites hatred in its people as a means of control
The country would be invaded and the leadership executed
Iran will become more influential in the region which is bad because it funds terrorists
Anticipated replies If Iran has a nuke it will destroy Israel
The common assumption and statement repeated by politicians is that a nuclear Iran is completely unacceptable
There is an extremely high likelihood it would be traceable back to them
A nuclear Iran would cause a nuclear arms race in the Middle East This is the phrase generally used but as far as I can tell the only one racing would be Saudi Arabia
Having a nuke would only increase its influence because it would be able to act without the threat of a U
and allies are currently engaged in proxy conflicts with Iran Iranian nukes would not change these conflicts

I feel like there is a backlash against immigration for multiple reasons like racism not immigrating well and crimes
On the other hand if you come to another country because you fear for your life and know that you will be kicked out if you commit a crime then being a criminal is apparently so important to you that the country would be completely justified in kicking you out
My view is that asylum seekers should be deported when they commit a crime even if that means the asylum seeker might be killed in his or her country of origin
I feel that people might be more welcoming to asylumseekers if they are known to not be criminals and that that causes both racism and not immigrating well to lessen

Points Computers have become easier to use but generally do this by removing choice not by improving usability
The user friendliness leads to a paradigm where users are not expected nor required to in any way expend any effort in learning how to use a machine that they will be using a lot
How do you instruct a computer to copy all files that start with July and end with
jpg from a folder and all it s subfolders to a separate folder titled Camping Photos The population of Americans who are brand new to computing is shrinking every day and will continue shrinking due to death
For instance I won t sit here and tell you that the Files and folders metaphor for organizing information on machines wasn t successful
Also the functionality of a computer nowadays is being restricted heavily by catering computers to the lowest common denominator of computer users ie I just borrowed my grandsons computer to send a virtual e mail to Susan
People develop metaphors for interactions with machines and some of these become standards
This means users are dumber and more likely to break things
Most people these days do not know how to do simple tasks on computers
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
What is a briefcase When I say Library are you thinking of That folder that isn t a folder that contains shortcuts to all my shit or are you thinking A file full of programming functions that allows a programmer to utilize features without having to write it all themselves By hiding machine functionality the quality of that functionality degrades
How many times have you seen someone link to a photo or a document by saying Here click this C Users JCena Files pr0n
Microsoft is especially guilty of this
gif Modern computers have many abstraction layers that separate a user from the actual actions being taken
I think a vast majority of our security problems on our networks and computational devices stems from technical illiteracy from the everyday user
As such it is illogical to have them be the standard to which software is designed
People who have had computers available their entire lives are incapable of troubleshooting the machines that they ve grown up with from a small age as their interactions with the machine have been simplistic and uninteresting
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
People who have no interest in politics and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their patriotic duty or that they are supposed to
I believe it is the duty of all citizens eligible for voting to do so but only as informed citizens
EDIT to clarify what I would consider the standard to be for a low information voter Someone who has watched none of the various political debates leading up to the election and cannot differentiate what major policies beliefs are traditionally associated with which party
Please note that this does not mean that their right to vote should be infringed simply that other people should not encourage them to do so
If they are unwilling to become informed they should not be encouraged to vote
Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed
What I can t understand is why we are clinging to the past to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today
In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had We cannot know
Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people
It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws
CMV _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
CMV Edit Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over
The fact is it is outdated
All men are equal shoule read all persons prohibition and its repeal should just be removed the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact
I am saying we should interpret it for today update it and use our revised version instead
It would take a lot of work a lot would change but I believe we would be better for it
Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable That thought only white male property owners should could vote Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant
To CMV you need to show me that having an old poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms
I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic
I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time
We should update revise and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are
The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age
I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either
They change based on technology public conscious and international relations
Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it
It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be
We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs
We should not force our ideas through time expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers
No I am saying we need an updated reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today
Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards making it difficult to tease out meaning
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Rutte broke his promise and kept sending billions of Euros to Greece
He cannot break it when he is elected
An Unbreakable Promise would be some kind of legal contract that describes what a politician certainly will or will not do when he is elected
For that politician the Unbreakable Promise would be like some kind of extra constitution
Dutch politician promised voters that not one extra penny would go to Greece
I think this is a great idea and I d love to know if there are any significant downsides to these kind of promises
These Unbreakable Promise should be fully available online for all candidates
Lying politicians are a problem in many countries
Voters liked that and Rutte s party became the biggest party in parliament and Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands
I think there s an easy solution let them make Unbreakable Promises
people here still insist that women s breast are sexual organs and the fact that women here in america unlike women in africa or other countries in europe are still too afraid to go topless outside when its too hot kinda punctuates this believe
so i was wondering if this is correct that maybe you guys can then convince me that they are sexual organs
I also like to point out that i was watching that documentary the other day on Netflix and it really touched me
i think it really is unfair that during heatwave days a man can take his shirt off in public yet women can t
growing up in america i was condition to believe women s breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much
i think we americans are too damn dramatic going judgmentally ballistic when we see boobs in public
we also must forget that or government does believe they are sexual breast as it is against the law either way for women to go topless out in the streets
lets also not forget that women do need their breast to breastfeed their children which this obviously screams out that they cant be sex organs
i thought that would of been the worst and most humiliating nightmare for an American woman
anyways it seems like the more i try to believe this the more negative reactions i get from those around me
i mean obviously we men have breast too and our breast dont stimulate the opposite sex in any different way
ps speaking of legal not that i have anything against gay people or anything but i m actually kinda surprised that today gay marriage is legal yet it s still illegal for women to go out topless in public
it wasnt till recently that i came to conscious and started realizing that there is practically no way a woman s breast could be sexual organs
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
at the same do to how we americans have been sexually conditioned since day one i m actually amazed that there are women here who complain about not being able to go topless out in public
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
and yes i m well aware that during sex women could receive lots of stimulation through them in the act of foreplay
but so do other body parts like the neck the mouth the foot etc
TL DR Keep your nose out of other people s business you judgmental asshole
Now all of a sudden it is fine to go outing all these other men who were cheating or attempting to cheat on their spouses It s the exact same situation that the businessman in the Gawker article was in but because it is 1 million people instead of just one specific person we don t feel sympathy That s bullshit
I worry that the response to this leak is going to be out of proportion to the general social backlash that a cheater receives
Maybe it s an open non monogamous relationship
Ashley Madison was a website for cheaters
Maybe the guy was cheating with the blessing of his wife
Reddit collectively denounced Gawker for publishing the allegations that some businessman was visiting a male prostitute like a month ago
Just because you don t want to be cheated on it doesn t mean that you can judge cheaters who were in some situation that you know nothing about and are in no position to pass judgement on
Normally when someone cheats their relationship ends and that is more or less the extent of it
Maybe we as society shouldn t be in the position to judge other people s personal lives just because we disagree with someone else s action
And generally cheating is wrong but it isn t always wrong
Also look at the fucking hypocrisy
There was a vox article about the lives of people who twitter has shamed after their shaming
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Maybe the wife was completely shut down sexually and the choice was between having an affair on the side to fulfill his sexual needs or throw away an otherwise happy marriage
These people have a right to privacy
The nature of this leak is such that it will expose thousands of people to blackmail and professional consequences all for something that while morally unacceptable in our society is not criminal
The internet leaking into people s lives ruins thing for people permanently
For someone who claims to be a textualist this appears to me to be a stretch
I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not

I don t find the appeal to history compelling
On a similar note we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount
The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods
Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this
I ll bullet point for my reasoning More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them
In the fairness of discussion and because I know everyone put in a lot of hard work if you would like to discuss this issue further please feel free to pm me and we ll talk
Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent firearms pose a net loss for society
The 2nd amendment and it s current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation
If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies that wouldn t make it okay
If you have responded please have some satisfaction in knowing I read every single post from start to finish
Because more responses will just result in more downvotes I m not going to respond anymore
Edit Unfortunately this doesn t seem to be a space in which I can respond to anyone without being heavily downvoted
One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment
Our logical balance doesn t make sense
I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things
Sorry this is mostly applicable to folks from the US but feel free to weigh in no matter what
But so many people shoot up so many schools and we still haven t done anything substantial about it
I ve read Scalia s opinion in D
To paraphrase John Oliver one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security
It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi automatic and automatic weapons just doesn t make sense
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
One of the arguments for gun rights is what worked for Australia couldn t work for us
I believe that if you want something to change that the best and more or less only way to do it is through grass roots activism eg
We kept CSG mines out of our community by fighting the actual companies and protesting instead of relying on politicians the same thing recently happened on a larger scale with the Adani coal mine an example in the US would be the introduction of bodycams on police and heightened scrutiny of their behavior in general thanks to regular peoples social activism
I have no faith in our political system its fundamentally ineffective and archaic to the extent that i dont see a huge difference in policy no matter who ends up being elected
they had something to do with the main storyline
I would give it a solid B and that s being generous
But for me the rest of the game falls flat on it s face
While it does have some defining features I don t think Red Dead has lived up to the hype and I damn sure don t feel like it deserves all the praise it s gained
To top it off the game as a whole is pretty slow
Not to mention even though the game was packed full of content I think it s more of a flaw than anything
Since it has so much more data packed into it I experienced more bugs and glitches here than in any other game I ve played
It s so bad that I had to restart my 360 a few times after it bugged out during important missions and on PS3 it seemed to crash whenever it felt like it even when loading duels or missions
I like some of the characters John Marston being my favorite for his sense of morality I can appreciate the scale of the game being one of the largest games of all time
I don t know if it s the old West setting forcing you to travel on horseback or how the missions are spread out all over the place or maybe Rockstar decided to try something new but GTA IV came out two years earlier and I had much more fun playing through that
The only ones that immediately come to mind is Seth and Abraham and that s only because I found them annoying
I can dig the concept An open world GTA style game set in the old West
The story is WAY too sluggish a lot of missions I played were more to side missions building up to the main storyline
In Red Dead I felt a lot of the missions were to help out one character or another before any progress was made towards the main goal When you enter Mexico for the first time I feel there s about 4 5 hours between getting there and making any actual progress in the main quest
I don t consider this to be an A game
If they had not put so much data into it or waited until the technology was better it would probably been on par with how GTA V is and I d be singing a different tune
Of course side missions are to be expected in Rockstar games but in something like GTA IV or V there was at least a point to them i
While I do like some of the characters I don t find any of the other characters interesting at all
But let s take a different route
Title is self explanatory but I ll elaborate
But if the technological means came available to give me gills and a tail then a social movement would gather around mermaidism and people would expect to be taken seriously
The only reason were catering to these people instead of giving them the psychological care they deserve is because we have the means to
An individual being born with a given gender and appearing to be that gender and functioning perfectly as that gender but having a disconnect with how his mind feels about his body shows that his mind is sick
CMV Perhaps I should add I m a staunch libertarian while the above is my view I fully believe that if that s what they want to do then go for it this is America god damnit
I ve fielded the other side and spoken to some transgender individuals and I still don t buy the argument that it s not a mental illness
Mental illnesses are seen as a deviation of normal human thought or behavior
Let s say I genuinely believed I was a mermaid
You d think I m a loon my behavior and my belief goes against social norms I would be labeled as mentally ill
So well make it a social issue as to not leave these people out because now we don t have to
Behavior that we as animals find unnerving dangerous or anxiety inducing because of our biology are seen as mentally Ill behaviors or thoughts

Firstly in my honest opinion the dub is excellent
I d like to come to a conclusion relatively soon because I ll be backing up my DVDs on a file to avoid the unskippable Funimation promos and I ll have to pick an audio track
I guess I could pick two but I ll have to look into that
I get it If we were talking about a Kurosawa movie I would strongly urge people to watch subtitled
I can easily see myself watching subbed Except Fullmetal Alchemist
The biggest change has been that I went from watching dubbed to watching subbed
I want to give these people a chance to convince me to change my ways on this matter
The reason I ask is because it s such a big deal to some people to watch subs over dubs
I m not saying the original audio is bad or good or that I should or shouldn t give it a chance but I think they really nailed it with the English audio
There s two big reasons that compel me to watch dubbed
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
To me it makes sense that they would be speaking English and between this aesthetic and the fact that I m already used to it it might upset the experience to hear it all in Japanese

If someone has a child in the United States back then it usually meant they went through a lot to get to the US
Back then you couldn t just happen to be on vacation while pregnant
This is regarding anchor babies and the birth tourism that comes with it
I think this is beyond the spirit of the 14th amendment and the world today is different from when it was written
Many times also they are a burden to the healthcare system coming over and leaving without paying the bill especially if the child happens to need unexpected extra care

I am a 100 straight male as in I m ONLY into straight women lesbians gross me out though I don t care who s into who or who wants to marry each other people should be free to do as they wish
To be honest I barely even accept bisexual as a real thing
And the reason I am so sexually inexperienced is being a short 5 11 overweight ugly dark skinned man that literally no straight woman would ever call sexy or good looking
And the argument from the other side I ve heard before are that bisexuals tend to be more loving compassionate kind and open minded as they judge less on the person s outer exterior and more on their inner personality
However with all this said I am also a big hopeless romantic
Any girl who claims to be bisexual would want a woman way more than she would ever a guy
If I had orgies and stuff and banged every type of human being alive and had notches in the triple digits by now maybe I d be more understanding of it all
I then just feel betrayed afterwards thinking I was a fool for going after a girl who wants a girl
She literally has double the options to potentially cheat or leave me for someone else and cheating being dumped is even a problem in straight couple relationships
A bisexual girl s very likely not going to be monogamous and I m not into three ways lesbians or an open relationship
So if the whole theory that bisexuals are less shallow and more into who a person truly are then they would be a more suitable choice for me to go after assuming this is true
Constantly having to compete with women for her attention
So I don t get the whole Kinsey sex scale stuff beyond Straight and everything else
No matter how much I can t comprehend simultaneously being into both men and women at the same time equally
My ideal girl physical traits aside would be kind sweet gentle caring loving open minded an easy listener and a best friend
A bisexual girl s very likely to not want a relationship just casual sex and fooling around
Basically I have a hard enough time as it is with straight women and a bisexual girl is triple the drama with no added benefits
So I think that covers it all
But I m pretty vanilla and virginal at this point
Mainly I want a girl just to be into ME and no one else
I literally cannot even comprehend that it s so far from what I d personally want sexually speaking
I ve never been into bisexual women and if I m attracted to one or she s attracted to me and I find out she s into women or has sex with them it s pretty much a deal breaker from then on
But since science backs it up I have to back it up as being real as well
And I m sexually inexperienced so unlike the sexually advanced I don t have this whole rainbow of sexuality Kinsey scale level of experience behind me
I m open to changing my mind on it if people are intelligent and open minded enough to convince me why I could potentially be wrong about my stance on bisexuals
My biggest concerns if I dated a bisexual girl are A
Headquarters denied having any information on Oswald other released documents show this was a lie and specifically that the CIA staff who wrote the memo denying knowledge of Oswald had also been regularly checking out and reading FBI files on his activities particurly for the two weeks before denying they had any information on him
Edgar Hoover was furious and to quote the Frontine article When FBI Director Hoover learned of this lie he was not amused
This is based on records which had been sealed following the assassination but which were declassfied in the 1990s following the release of the 1993 JFK Records Act
Eighteen days after the assassination he censured demoted or transferred everyone in the FBI that had been touched by the Mexico City story
That said I m very interested to read any counters or refutations anyone can provide _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I can t forget CIA withholding the French espionage activities in USA nor the false story re Oswald s trip in Mexico City only to mention two of their instances of double dealing
Frontline did a fairly in depth article on this which does a better job of explaining it than I can But here are the high points When Oswald went to Mexico the local CIA office asked headquarters for information on him
We say claiming to be because the CIA produced audio tapes of the conversation and photos of the man claiming to be Oswald which were determined after the assassination not to be Oswald
And their reaction when the impersonation was revealed seems to indicate some complicity in it certainly Hoover thought the CIA cooked the whole thing up
Hoover pulled out his pen and in his characteristic large thick handwriting scrawled OK but I hope you are not being taken in
But even if you don t believe that particular interpretation it is difficult to come up with a benign rationale for the CIA s actions
Why I find this convincing What is striking about this is that bare minimum we have confirmed documentary evidence that the CIA were monitoring Oswald and were lying to both their own staff and the FBI about Oswald s activities weeks before the assassination
There are further theories the most common one is that they knew the assassination was coming and wanted to create a false connection between the assassin and the Soviets to justify action against the Soviet Union
The crux of this involves a trip Lee Harvey Oswald took to Mexico City in September 1963
While he was in Mexico someone claiming to be Lee Harvey Oswald contacted a KGB assassin named Valery Kostikov at the Soviet Embassy
Hoover was still fuming about it in January 1964 when his subordinates sent him a memo on illegal CIA operations in the US which stated that the CIA had promised to keep the Bureau informed
I have been doing some reading about JFK lately and have come across something that seemed significantly more convincing than the usual Oliver Stone stuff you tend to hear about
When the FBI asked for more information the CIA office in Mexico City falsely claimed that all copies of the tapes had been destroyed
There are a number of very weird things about this trip and the CIA s involvement in it

Spreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they ll be crippling
So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar and then you re handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil you should always pick the person who got the salad bar
I think that in the first 2 rounds when you have a choice you should always target whoever already has a sabotage
Often this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged
You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally
The reason is this you do not win a round of CTK

Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked and keep the money remaining
Another example is that social security shares the risk through out the society let s say a kid with diabetic can procreate and pass his her gene to the gene pool because of access to treatment and medication
EDIT 1 people with obesity apparently have reduced chance of procreation which means their genes have a higher chance to be removed from the gene pool
I am not saying this is bad but these characteristics dampen natural selection thus evolution
Better access to these allow individual with less adapted genes to survive and procreate
Human being can not evolve further
In monogamous relationship the chance of a person with better traits to procreate roughly similar to those with worse traits
At this point in time most people has access to limit or even remove environmental stress from their lives altogether
Evolution requires environmental stress in order to select better adapted traits to spread to the population
EDIT 2 the very things that remove the environmental stresses may eventually bring about the apocalyptic scenario on a massive scale forcing Homo sapiens evolution
Over time this spreading of traits drives evolution forward
Taking these into consideration and without any apocalyptic situations I think human can not evolve further and we are basically evolutionary dead end

We live in a very different time now and a popular election would be the best way to elect a president as many people s votes simply don t count in our current system
So what say you Show me the errors of my ways and convince me that the electoral college really is the best and most fair way to choose the president
Conservatives in California and liberals in Alabama both have no real reason to go vote on election day
Our current system does not encourage voter turnout when you are in a clear minority
A popular vote would ensure every vote counts and would even give independent and third party candidates a real chance fair shot at the presidency where they don t now
I believe the electoral college was established at a time when much fewer people voted fewer people had basic educations and voting only took place in 13 states leaving the possibility of a single large state dominating the election very possible
EDIT This means please don t argue Voter ID I m not including that because I can see legitimate reasons to support it but the overall admitted strategy of reducing voter turnout admitted to below
I try very hard to see both sides of any issue
Please help me find another way to look at this
I honestly believe that most normal people want what s best for their country but they have different ideas either of what is best or what s the best way to achieve it
I can see the argument for Voter ID in theory but the other measures have one objective make it harder for poor voters to cast their ballot
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I can t imagine anyone who has any idealism about democracy especially someone who considers themselves a patriot not wanting all legal voters to cast a ballot
But particularly since the recent limitations of the protections granted by the Voting Rights Act the Republicans have jumped on every opportunity to limit voting reducing hours eliminating early voting passing voter ID rules and on and on
There are some pretty damning quotes from Republicans about their true intent
I don t want to be cynical but I don t see any other way to view this other than Republicans valuing winning over respecting the democratic process
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
My views align with most Libertarians but I find that I have to vote for the most moderate conservative candidate to find the best match with any kind of chance
they would not have a realistic chance based solely on the fact that they have not declared as one of Americas only two relevant parties
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
It seems to me that even if an amazing candidate ran for POTUS as a Libertarian Green Party etc
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
This upsets people like me that find themselves very fiscally conservative but socially liberal
Our political system does not preclude independents from winning elections so any argument that an independent s only real chance of winning is to seek the nomination of a party with which he does not formally affiliate is historically and demonstrably invalid
3 The members of a political party s presidential ticket are the de facto leaders of their national party during and after the election
It is nonsensical and unfair to party members for their de facto leaders to be from another party or no party at all especially given that nominations are mostly a function of popular vote
These resources often come from contributions governed by election law made by party members or supporters to support fellow party members
Sanders is the longest serving independent in the Senate
2 Many third parties with access to general election ballots often nominate the same person which causes that individual to appear on the ballot several times for the same position
This duplication is unfair to candidates from other parties who may only appear on the ballot once
Edit I understand a lot of people on reddit are Bernie Sanders supporters and that my view might argue against his candidacy in the Democratic primary
Ross Perot staged a pretty successful third party run for president in 1992
The same principle applies for nominees for Governor at the state level Mayor at the municipality level etc
Nominees political positions are often absorbed into the general party platform which can impact elections and party voter turnout elsewhere
1 Parties spend a substantial amount of resources to try to elect their nominees
Some of the leading candidates are of questionable party affiliation or are unabashedly independent of any party affiliation
The 2016 US presidential primary race is well underway and the large pool of candidates in both major political parties is exposing a significant gap in the nominating process
Many other people have been elected to political office at various levels of government without obtaining a major party nomination
For the record I am not a Clinton or a Trump supporter nor am I decidedly against Sanders as a candidate if he makes to the general election
I hope my replies are not being downvoted because I am not 100 in favor of Sanders
This has led to a lot of controversy on both sides about throwing the weight of the party behind someone whose allegiance to the party is questionable and with good reason
It is inappropriate to allocate these resources to someone who despite achieving the nomination is not even a member of the party in the first place
4 There is nothing wrong with or prohibitive about running for office as an independent
For the following reasons I believe that by law only registered members of a political party should be able to seek and obtain that party s nomination for elected office
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
For the purposes of the official ballot parties should only be allowed to formally nominate their own members or no one at all
However due to scientific evidence I m convinced that there is more genetic variation within human populations than there is between
However I ve spoken with some interesting characters who are convinced there is evidence to believe that there are quite large differences between so called human races and they therefore think this is a justification for lets say proto racism
The primary study I ll use as a source of my view is Richard Lewontin The Apportionment of Human Diversity
However there are a lot of studies that have repeated his findings and conclusions
EDIT I should have clarified I m talking about race from a biological perspective
I m not denying that race exists as a social and cultural construct I m denying that it exists as a biological construct
Doesn t matter if it even exist
English is already the de facto business language of the western world and a very popular secondary language
Edit I m pretty soundly convinced that an international auxiliary language would benefit the world
That s not going to change
Convince me one would be better than those stated and I ll change my mind
Doesn t matter if it s organic or constructed
Please remember that there are loads of languages that were invented for this very purpose
The idea of an international auxiliary language is to have a secondary language people can learn to communicate with people outside your native tongue
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
It is an official language of many countries and the default language in the Anglo sphere Canada USA Australia and New Zealand Can someone explain what advantages any other constructed invented language have that either English or German does not Edit I will reward delta to anybody able to convince me that another language would be far superior
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Just give me a realistic possibility of a language that outperform English and or German as an IAL
What I m really looking for is what language would be better than English or German

yay for the first past the post voting and the two party system you guys may think I m being cynical and overly condescending to the political process
The GOP have a bizarre tendency to vote for the best older serious looking guy
Trump and Bernie Sanders a popular fringe candidates that people like but wont really vote for come rubber meets the road Obama was not down low uncontroversial president thus the people in the middle of the political spectrum are going to go with the Republicans

In the near future self driving cars will replace a lot of jobs
When that happens human labor will become as redundant as horse labor
In the comments a lot of people concluded that this means that in the future technology will keep creating more jobs than it destroys
As long as our civilization does not collapse technology and AI will keep getting better
For example having a conversation is very hard for AI
This kind of stuff will keep happening until mechanical brains outperform human brains at a similar or lower cost
So there are still lots of simple jobs that cannot be done by technology
Yesterday there was this post in r futurology titled
At the moment a five year old kid can beat a computer in a lot of things
The other main argument from the other side is to call people with my point of view terrible people and try to shame us
For that you take the risk of the women not able to endure properly and be able to carry heavy equipment and the possibility of the women being a distraction to the men among other unforeseen problems
I do not see any way I could be convinced that men and women are the same and not being treated fairly
I do not think they should have to endure the horrors of military combat like men do
The primary focus of the military should be only to increase the efficiency of its operations
Having women in the military will only cause problems
The arguments for women in military combat roles seem to center around appeals to discrimination and this is not going to convince me
The purpose of the military is to conduct its operations the best it can it does not owe anything to women or to treat people fairly
I have nothing at all against women
The military does not owe any group anything and it has no obligation to accommodate women
At best you will get a couple more people the few women who can pass the physical standards
This also will not be effective
Being responsible for reproduction I think a woman s life actually has a bit more worth than a mans and therefore we should keep them out of harm s way
In all I don t see any reason why women should have combat roles in the military
Men are more expendable than women are
In fact part of the reason I hold this view is because I like women so much
The child that ensues as a result however is not
TL DR You shouldn t have to pay for a baby if you didn t want the baby and just got unlucky were stupid
I don t think either party having to take responsibility for something they didn t want didn t intend to happen is right
I don t believe there are many pregnancies where one party was solely at fault though I may be wrong on this
Any place where it isn t both parties are conceivably being forced to bear the pregnancy and any costs associated with bearing it should be split
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Note This should only apply to jurisdictions where abortion is legal
While rare and definitely not the norm the idea that anyone can pay so heavily for something they didn t legally consent to is pretty shocking
This way mothers who don t want the child but may be opposed to an abortion can surrender the child to the father without worrying about any legal ramifications
That s only if it s going up for adoption of course
Any visitation rights contact influence will be at the discretion of the now sole legal guardian
At birth the baby will be delivered retained by the person who did not sign the waiver and raised by them and them alone
As a result if they choose not to be a part of don t want that child I think they should be absolved of pregnancy birth child rearing fees
This is based on the logic that most pregnancies that are unwanted are either accidents or intentional
The male has few rights and none of them concrete in most countries in the past virtually every lawsuit to initiate or prevent an abortion has failed
I think that our current system is pretty fucked honestly especially because of incidents like
I think regardless of circumstances of conception the biological mother father should be able to opt out of parental rights and responsibilities
She can choose to carry it to term or she can choose to abort it
The way our society is currently structured a woman has 100 control over what happens to a baby regardless of circumstances regarding conception
I think that bodily autonomy is important however I also believe that equal rights are important
Similarly any male who doesn t want to participate in the raising of the child should be able to sign a form and waive all legal rights and responsibilities including child support
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I think a woman should have full rights to control her body and the pregnancy is definitely a matter of bodily autonomy
Not even talking in the line of respect like EMS and defense forces deserve
A few people I ve brought up mention things like well they lived through x
This seems like a really flawed basis for deserving respect
So this will be hard to pad out as it is the absence of a thing
Again simply living through a national or global event hardly seems worthy of respect
In short respect should be earned and the mere act of not dying does not suffice for that

That being said I believe that utilizing a cell phone in a radio esque manner should be defensible in court legal or car stereos should be illegal
In fact I d argue that its less dangerous for a person to hit the button on an iphone and ask siri for something than it is to divert their attention to their car stereo
I would argue that if the goal was to eliminate distractions then it should be just as illegal to own a motor vehicle with a stereo system

It makes sense because at the time the range of empirical observations we had available to us was tiny
I m arguing that what makes us call something philosophy instead of science is the distance the conclusions are away from the observations being used
The only difference being to what degree our hypotheses have to rely on logic alone to extend their reach because available and confirmed observations for such complex subjects are still way beyond our reach
Philosophy is a key part of the process but it does not exceed the process
We re just out on the ledge
I m claiming that everything of use in philosophy is included as an integral part of the scientific method
We still can t build particle accelerators but we can start to get serious about self consistency in our arguments from intuition
I argue we discovered religious hypotheses first because they only need intuition to get off the ground
What we normally refer to as the distinction between philosophy and the scientific method is really a matter of degree and not of kind
First I m not saying philosophy is useless
It soon became clear that this wasn t just another aspect of philosophical study
Everything useful in philosophy is contained within the forming a hypothesis based on existing information part of the scientific method
If we re musing about what kind of actions lead to living a content life then we re doing philosophy
They even referred to science as natural philosophy at first
And so because of the circumstances of history we came to see the scientifc method as separate from the philosophical method
This helped but we still had another breakthrough to make
Otherwise it will all just collapse into my seemingly self consistent logical framework versus your seemingly self consistent logical framework or as we usually refer to it the Middle East conflict
Or at least I think it doesn t
A good philosopher takes observations about reality and tries to fit them into a logical scheme of explanation that is consistent with everything that has been observed in the past
I think the only reason this is even confused is because of a historical coincidence
The next thing that would occur is the discovery of logic
If we are musing about the theoretical possibilities of a probability density of quarks then we re doing science
That is the scientific method or more accurately it is a part of the scientific method
Biology is a specific application of the scientific method
The extra part is the empirical work of trying to validate the explanation by making further observations
I think the situation was the exact opposite
Where we finally realized that logic and intuition must be tempered by careful and exact measurements
In this sense philosophy is distinct from biology
And searching for an artists brings up an incoherent blob of song results
The song I deleted is still playing
The UI is pretty terrible Clicking on the burger bar on the right hand side brings up the Play Queue but while you re on the queue you can t see anything else
But my criticisms are specific to the web app
You can t use your queue to Save As an existing playlist
Any songs you add automatically get added to the end of the playlist no matter what
You also have My Library where you can save songs and albums so you can easily find them later
Adding to playlist requires two clicks
Spotify makes me do it one by one
The only service I ve seen that did this was Grooveshark 3
And the glitches found in Spotify are missing deleting a song from a playlist automatically plays the next song without having it show some other song playing instead
The downloads are yours for as long as you have the paid service with no 30 day limitations
The right click menus are bad The menus when you right click on songs in a playlist are not intuitive
That is twice as many steps as there needs to be
A lot of playlists though I ll give them that
You can select whole playlists for download and it will auto sync whenever you add a new song to the playlist and automatically download it
fm has extensions that scrobble music from all your services not just Spotify
Any artist even slightly underground has entire albums missing from the collection
Since Spotify and Google Music are priced the same I ll compare the two
You don t have to make a separate account or link anything to Facebook
Things I don t like about Google Music 1
When I right click and select Save I don t know where I m saving to
The web and mobile versions work as expected they are both maintained equally and both have the same features
Laughably horrible selection of music and stations This was the first thing I noticed when using Spotify for the first time
There is no option to skip duplicates when adding to a playlist it just silently adds the duplicates without asking
I have to individually select whether I want Nick Cave or Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds because when I look at the song list the first eight songs don t even have Nick Cave listed as the main artist
The only better selections I ve seen are Youtube and Grooveshark
There are also a ton of radio stations for almost any mood genre you could think of along with a bunch of playlists available along with any search results
I m using the web version of Spotify so maybe the desktop app got way amazing since I last used it a year ago
They have to be played separately
I m sure if I was a true Spoify fan I would
You can also Play Next along with Add to Queue which Spotify doesn t seem to have
And this makes it impossible to see the queue update as you add songs without multiple clicks as well as making it impossible to drag songs onto the queue
I have to click away from the song and click back just to have it showing the right song playing
Google Music is better First of all you can add your own music libraries to Google Music so if there is something missing you can just supplement it with your own copy of the song you want
Bad offline download policies Spotify Premium allows you to download songs to your device
And Google Music actually asks you if you want to skip duplicates
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
And there aren t a lot of radio stations to choose from unless I m missing something
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I have to click the back button just to go back to where I was
And clicking away to anything but the left sidebar is impossible
For a simple thing like that you have to load up your big old desktop app
No one uses the web app Well I use it because I don t want to download an extra program onto my computer
You can sync your libraries across all your devices Also if some songs are missing there is Youtube integration which will probably have the video somewhere for that song
You can add it into your playlists seamlessly
But Spotify has the friends feature Obviously the answer to this is to use last
And even if you do use the desktop app if you happen to want to do a quick check in without loading up the desktop app maybe move around a song or two in a playlist before a party you can t do it
You can t yet add Youtube videos into your playlists
You can of course download individual songs as well
And the play queue can be brought up in the lower corner of the screen so you can scroll around on the main screen while your queue is still up
Even besides all that the music selection is much much better than Spotify
You can Play and Add To Play Queue but you can t Play Next
But I argue that since the web app is the first to be seen by people new to Spotify you d think they would put more effort into making it actually functional
I don t know if you just have to go back online to keep the songs or you have to re download them but it s pretty inconvenient to come back to find that a bunch of songs you thought you had aren t there
Since Spotify seems to be the de facto standard for most people in my 18 24 age bracket please CMV and let me see what the fanboys see
Offline playing is a lot less locked down
Searching and selecting songs is a multi step process I want to search for a song and immediately add it to my queue or playlist
You can t drag search results into the queue
They openly admit that their web app is less maintained
When I delete a song the song after the deleted one shows as playing but it s not
If you re signed into google you can use it
but only for a maximum of 30 days offline
Last but not least you can use it without being signed in to a special service
And of course unlike Spotify s web app you can select multiple songs at once and add delete them as you wish
You can t select multiple songs you have to add delete one at a time
I don t want to have to click on it wait for it to load right click the song and THEN add it to my queue
Just artist based radio and a couple of genre based stations
Most people have heard of and use Spotify many of my friends included
I ve tried and tried to like Spotify but after using a ton of other music services I ve concluded that Spotify is incredibly terrible and doesn t deserve the fanbase it has
Unlike Spotify s web app you can drag songs around in your queue and playlists and you can drag songs from the search results directly into playlists something which requires the multi step right clicking frenzy I mentioned
You can Add Playlist to Playlist which is useful for when I want to pare down my ten thousand playlists into one master playlist
I m not sure if Spotify Premium has this
You re essentially locked into Spotify for all your music if you want your friends to have an accurate view of what kind of music you listen to
Web version is very under maintained First of all Spotify comes in desktop web and mobile forms
The only service I ve seen that can do this was you guessed it Grooveshark
fm shares your scrobbles with everyone not just signed in people on your friends list
The web version is not maintained very well and doesn t support rearranging playlists or dragging at all nor does the UI respond well when deleting a song from a playlist

With Trump to quite Iain Dey in the London Times Large numbers of Americans are struggling to get their opinions up to speed with the liberal agenda and they are fed up with being ignored
Voter feel these two Upset at the pace of change
The USA is deeply split in its range of ideologies Obama felt it prudent to oppose Gay marriage officially when he first ran for President due to this in order to gain enough votes
So please change this l il Limey s view that these two candidates gain support for offering their responses to many of the same problems
is why a candidate currently percieved to be a joke is leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination
Support for people percieved to fall less into donor s pockets
Voters are fed up with the highly polished and spin doctored politicians with overtly similar views that make up the rest of the leadership candidates
In response they support people with seemingly strongly felt policy proposals messages and who have only if at all existed at the forefront of mainstream politics
A response to the emergence of political dynasties
Trump talks about forcing companies to situate factories in the USA especially in cities on steep decline like Detroit
Conversely others feel that Sanders would push their nation towards a more tolerant and open nation and more supportive of minorities and the less well off
In effect people are moving to support these two candidates mostly in response to the same set of events Disillusionment with the political establishment
Upset at being left behind financially
Moreover they feel the insularity of groups within political circles leads to a strong divergence from doing what is best for the people to doing what is best for the elite
Sanders stands against this kind of selling out and Trump would seem to be rich enough to fund himself
This is how it appears to me as a non American
Hillary and Jeb both feel like rehashes of past presidents and voters fear an arrogance and weakening of democracy if familial dominance is extended

Sanders talks about raising the minimum wage organising co ops and unions and making trade deals beneficial to the American people
I think this is a dumb way to eat since by the time you re done with the rest of the meal the best piece is cold
I have friends that will save the best part of whatever it is that they re eating for last claiming that they want to have something to look forward to as they eat or end the meal on the highest note
When I was a kid it was hamburger day at school and I had removed the pickles from my burger because they were my favorite thing about the crappy school burger
So I eat the best bite first because that way I don t run the risk of my 2nd grade teacher swooping in and eating my saved bite
I left them on my plate so I could eat them last then my teacher reaches down and eats my pickles 8 year old me was devastated
Or you re too full to enjoy it
Through some soul searching I have unearthed why I always eat the best bite first
edit ok good points brought up by people
And if the meal was good enough to have a best piece the whole meal should be a high note
The flag obviously represents that union
I argue that Southern Culture to a large extent doesn t truly exist
Surrounding the debates on Confederate flags and imagery those who support such imagery often argue that it is a beneficial symbol of Southern Culture
TL DR The South is an incredibly large and diverse area which renders the phrase Southern Culture nearly meaningless
Southern Culture in the context of the Confederate flag is simply History of Bigotry
As a native Texan who has also spent some time in Georgia my view is that the region differs widely Atlanta and Nashville are incredibly different
Houston and New Orleans have vastly different histories cuisines and cultures
Even North and South Carolina are vastly different states
The South as a region is defined explicitly based on historical support for slavery
Even if a Southern Culture exists the Confederate Flag is a particularly poor representation of it given the great amount of history outside of the Civil War and given the Flag s constant connection to pro slavery forces and anti segregation racists
AFAIK we neither have a symbol of Mid Atlantic Culture nor does such a concept exist
The idea that the entire region shares a culture outside of a historical support for slavery that continued longer than in other parts of the country and an overt resistance to equal rights to me is a very literal and not at all subtle extension of Lost Cause propaganda
What creates the geography of the region we call the South is undoubtedly the support for slavery
When I return I ll address any points I am able that I ve missed and award deltas
However I contend that there is definite diminishing returns and negative returns associated with making points overly long

My point of view is more about rhetoric than being rigorously correct
I m aware that there exists concepts that cannot be expressed in short form
EDIT_1 Thanks to everyone who has responded thus far
I ve had a few minor deltas and at this point now I ve made the following modifications to my position
On my mobile so I ll be short also it would be ironic if I wasn t
I m saying that communicating these concepts cannot reliably survive the medium of the Reddit post and still be effective at changing views
The optimal length doesn t have to be a paragraph
For ideas complex enough to require long explanations I still believe that the internet is a much less effective medium for this discussion than other options
EDIT_2 For clarity I am intending on awarding deltas to a handful of users but not until my position is settled
EDIT_3 I am going AFK for a few hours
If you can t distill your point into a few well chosen sentences you probably don t have enough mastery over the subject to convince anyone
If you can t make your point in a paragraph then you re not going to convince anyone

Obviously there is no such mindset when people say I am only sexually attracted to
A person s race and gender is something they were born with they didn t choose they can t easily change
Things like you re the only I ve ever been attracted to are also grossly offensive
In modern society it is racist to say something like I d totally date you if you weren t
Even though I genuinely feel that it isn t sexist to be monosexual I still haven t found an arguement convincing enough to make me think otherwise
Why does this double standard exist when it comes to romance but not for job opportunites education and politicians Why don t we think being monosexual is sexist the same way we think not wanting to date certain races is racist Both are judging someone for who they are on the outside
And as absurd as the thought that if you aren bisexual pansexual then you re sexist sounds my brain can t reconcile the logic with how I feel
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
No one calls you sexist or a bigot for being monosexual
Ethiopians are not like Nigerians Irish are not like Russians Japanese are not like Burmese it is an inaccuracy to try and group them together based on physical characteristics such as complexions and hair types
These definitions ultimately only have tangible realities in post colonial societies places that were subjected to racial laws in the past specifically
Racism exists and racial preferential treatments exist
It is as accurate as calling someone African European and Asian peoples from continental masses that have massive disparate cultures languages and histories
These terms have maintained racist conventions historically and will continue to maintain such conventions as long as they exist and are used in colloquial discourse
These racial definitions like the racial laws of the past serve only the interests of those invested in the notion of racial segregation
Similar descriptions of Irish civilization cannot be accurately described as white or Ming dynasty as being mongoloid
I also cannot see the value of describing ancient Egyptian society as being black because black was a term invented thousands of years after the ancient Egyptian civilization ended
I am not advocating that all too often view of white people that I dont see race and therefore it does not exist
Black and white are terms used to describe people that have such disparate variations that it is ultimately only defined by complexion and even then it is not accurate
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
These groups are varied in such dramatic ways that there is little similarities between them
Since they have been alerted in the past it is my conviction that they can and will be altered in the future
Socially constructed psychological cultural definitions of race exists as in black white Latino
Negroid Caucasoid mongoloid are conflations that have no accurate definitions
Furthermore these definitions have been altered over the course of so much so that the only definition is a recently socially constructed definition
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I believe that we can use these words to either maintain the conventions or discredit them to abandon these conventions
Clearly we do not live in such a world but religious individuals groups who insist that something should be illegal or made nearly impossible due to religious views are trying to make our world more like the one in the scenario I suggested above where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong
Without having the choice to do the wrong thing then doing the right thing is meaningless
Then in that world there would be no reason to praise or reward someone for doing the moral thing because there is no other option
Personally I m not religious so I guess I m trying to get some insight here
Therefore things like the belief that you should not murder people would not count as having a primarily religious nature because most people also find murder horrific in a separate sense from religion
Likewise there is no one who could possibly be punished
Here s the deal say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong
To phrase it differently if all alcohol disappeared from earth tomorrow and humans somehow could no longer make it would abstaining from drinking alcohol mean anything I don t think so
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Note I m only talking about things where the main reason for believing them is religion like beliefs about gay marriage premarital sex drinking alcohol etc
Thus forcing people to comply with the rules of your religion actually seem to make the rules less meaningful which seems like something that religious individuals would want to avoid
The arguments of any user shouldn t change because of a title if I say 2 2 4 that doesn t change based on whether I have a background in math or whether I m in grade school
I believe when a person uses a title they have they ve earned such as from schooling to assert their argument is correct this is often a logical fallacy
If I m genuinely wrong so be it I want to know
The young woman trusts the mechanic is being truthful because he is an assumed authority on cars
Users from a philosophy sub have disagreed with me on this and I m willing to hear legitimate arguments as to why I m wrong hopefully dropping the snark because I want them to share their ideas with me
Obviously not something so serious on reddit since in a caste system it affects peoples lives pretty dramatically and on reddit it just means a bunch of users are going to talk at you excessively
The mechanic charges her for changing her headlight fluid
Likewise if I make an argument the argument doesn t change based on me stating that I m an academic lt insert gt
It is an assertion that some people are better than others based on their title and that any arguments made to counter that are invalid because of a lack of that title
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I believe titles of authority are based solely on trust and not actual correctness
As a side note I think that asserting dominance based on a title hearkens strongly to class warfare not unlike those you would see in a caste system
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
An example I used We can take a popular example from tropes a young woman takes her car to a mechanic
I believe that a title of authority does not mean the individual is right but rather that it means you should consider their authority when deciding whether to trust someone or not
Does this mean the mechanic actually changed her headlight fluid Authority isn t about being right it s about trust
I absolutely don t pretend to have the problem of race all figured out but I do see it as something that by its nature can only be changed over the course of a long period of time through countless individual choices
More often than not these tactics are used by white people against their liberal peers or perhaps against naively insensitive family members because they know those are the softest targets the ones least likely to fight back and most likely to say Oh my I m sorry I didn t know I ll try to do better
For most people racism still just means judging someone else negatively because of their race a general act of bigotry that any race can perpetrate
Let s take for example the peculiar tendency for many of these people to lecture others about the basic definition of racism
That academic sense of racism is definitely a useful one but its use is not limited to shaming non academic whites
It s an incredibly disingenuous accusation because everyone knows this is still a pretty new thing
But the problem is they re not actually fighting anything
True racists continue to do their thing unmolested usually because they operate outside of the anti racist s carefully curated social circle
Black people in need are removed from the equation altogether they remain a purely intellectual problem
They re too busy having brunch or posting pictures of their cats
Patronize a black owned business vote out politicians with racist policies challenge racist views expressed by people you know personally
I d like to keep this specific to the problem of how a lot of white people choose to address inequality especially as it pertains to race
For a lot of people social justice is just a big game to see who can be the most sensitive
And this is how it s likely to stay as long as these whites continue to believe they re doing enough to feel satisfied with themselves simply by lecturing other well meaning white people
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
But it is an academic definition and until recently that was where it stayed
But that s a separate CMV probably
I don t see it as a problem that can be battled and defeated in the course of a single generation just by yelling very loudly at a lot of people
In the last several years a new and distinct sense of that word has gained more widespread use outside of academia which is something to the effect of Racism is a system of privileges designed to keep black people disadvantaged in perpetuity
It s different from how we normally think of racism mainly by 1 being systemic instead of personal 2 framing itself in such a way that white people must necessarily always be guilty of it and racial minorities especially black people can never be guilty of it
It may be easy to think that this is a relatively benign problem after all as long as these whites are fighting racism somehow it s all for the better
I feel that for the most part when white people talk about race they re motivated less by the desire to effect substantial change and more by one upmanship
Yet many white people will employ the newer definition in a game of gotcha catching people assuming the older broader definition and then accusing them of not understanding or even ignoring what racism really is
Disclaimer I myself am a white male
I think that movements like blacklivesmatter are valuable for their ability to maintain visibility and keep the country from growing complacent but they in themselves are not solutions
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
This isn t to say that they don t genuinely want to see inequality alleviated but they re not willing to actually put in the time or effort at true activism like say volunteering to sign people up to vote something like that
Part time employees which generally make less money often cannot take advantage of this
This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees
The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own informed choice rather than letting someone else make the decision for you
Point 1 The ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone s identity without an ID
The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote
I d make the argument that by not requiring ID s to vote they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting
I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming
Point 4 Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college we can start with the easy and low cost high benefit ones like free ID cards
And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix argue your want through
Point 2 I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way
The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting
Point 3 There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down
If you couldn t find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all
I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day s work
Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data
There s a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote or accepting anything for a vote
Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for
I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote
The Constitution as well as laws passed by Congress with the understanding they were specifically for war and would be used to target enemies grant the President the ability to expand certain powers and limit certain rights during wartime
The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals engendered by both
In the words of James Madison Of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other
Two obvious examples that come to mind are the US Government attempting to prosecute Edward Snowden under the 1917 Espionage Act and the way that RICO laws have been used against everyone from Anti Abortion protesters to divorce cases
No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
However now that America is fighting a literally unwinnable war on Violent Extremism those powers which were meant to be temporary and only used when absolutely necessary become a permanent part of the Executive Office and they begin to be used in situations they were not intended to be used in
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
In war too the discretionary power of the Executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people
War is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few
And in this scenario I assume it means something like be yourself but without any of the debilitating neurosis and subsequent façade
If I pretend then I am a pretender and that s who I am
Edit I ve changed my view to Be yourself is more often than not useless advice
Finally it s usually a cop out on the part of the advisor who incites this cliché in lieu of anything more profound or nuanced or comprehensive or useful
But even if you are held back by anxiety hiding behind a façade etc
Though how can anyone be other than themself It seems like whatever a person does by definition is being themself
Maybe be yourself means don t pretend to be someone you re not Again this very act of pretending is still me being myself
Is it just empty rhetoric meant as bit of comfort a morale boost Well then don t dress it up in misleading instructions
There there would be more useful plain
Also even if my true self is for some reason a me without these hang ups much of this assumes I have any choice or ability or inclination to change it and that free will exists
Does it mean be your best self If we could just flip a switch and become our best self wouldn t everyone leave it on all the time Don t overthink Fuck you
are these things not an integral part of the ego that constitutes the self Wouldn t someone co existing with these neuroses be closer to their true self than someone trying to change their mental state Perhaps
But this is just as useless
Don t you think if people could magically wish away such impediments they would have already done so It s possible that some people are able to do this but then they presumably wouldn t be in need of such banal advice
What does it even mean How can one not be one self Now I m mostly talking about the everyday use of the phrase where it is typically offered moments before an uncomfortable or unfamiliar social interaction like a date
Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes
REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do
For some it takes years to become good at it but it has to have a level of difficulty in my view that the average person can t easily attain
Lamar it would take longer and he has a nice flow but still it could be easily copied
They re both rappers and make good music i like
It s just in a whole nother caliber of music to me for the simple reason it s next to impossible to attain
Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James
Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat
Some rappers don t even try to make sense or be clever
It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics
So there are a few rappers who have some real talent
Edit 2 Let me clarify what talent is to me
So everyone is talented then in some way
It takes time and a pen and paper
Edit 1 Okay u scottevil110 pointed out to me performing or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act
They do what anyone can do
gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I can t believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards
It can be mastered relatively easy
You might say it takes skill to rap well
I already know what the webster definition is the natural ability or aptitude to do something
Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says and say it like him in a drunken stupor
Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then
Now REAL talent to me is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing
Let s take young thug as an example and Lamarr
Edit 3 u glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill
However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me
Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians
You can t say the same for singers that can sing on key
Some rappers are capable of this so i changed my view that some have talent in that regard but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek or Young Thug
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping
There s a large group of people in this circle that want a live action political forum and not an actual attempt to become part of the political scene
Abortion for example might be a frequently and publicly discussed topic but among insiders nobody has any ambition to curb abortion rights access since it would invariably chew into what little influence they have left in this part of the state
I didn t earnestly identify with the heavy social conservatism of the party so when I went to college I registered Libertarian
I did a lot of political work for the Ron Paul campaign I kept this registration through post graduate studies but practically speaking didn t feel like I could identify with Republicans and Libertarians
I was raised in a Republican household
Further the Republican Party is way more tied and obligated to the national platform and conversation
Recently I met with the head of the Conservative Party in my area
Since this is a me focused CMV let me offer some background about myself so we can all have some notion of what I mean by liberal and Conservative and so on
I realize there s always the risk of government creep but that s a risk with any party or platform and the only real remedy to this is dedicated vigilance against that encroachment
Conservatives are low on young people and women
As I have more responsibility and see my future develop I m more willing to take a guarded approach to political experimentation
I spent a lot of time thinking about the non aggression principle
I also thought a lot of libertarian esque programs were thinly veiled Republican initiatives and that libertarians took the Republican Alliance as a given
I used to like the aversion to hawkish confrontation only judiciously using that power as necessary but I don t much see that as part of the Democratic platform anymore
I applaud strong work ethic and ambition but there was too much Horatio Alger offered as tuff medicine and bravado
I m like most Millenials in that I tire of seeing petty squabbling in the political arena but I don t think the silver bullet is a special candidate whoever that may be or one sweeping electoral victory
There is already talk about the role I can play here and the potential credibility I can bring to the table
It s also such a liberal part of the US that conservative is relative
I think there is definitely a time where you re insulated from some of the more practical considerations of politics and this is a great opportunity to explore the foundation of where you want to stand
There s an understanding that this is giving into a political machine that will sully otherwise bona fide libertarian activism and principles
I did the whole thing read a lot of Mises Bastiat Acton
Republicans for the previously mentioned reasons which worsened and I thought Libertarians were too averse to practical problem solving because that frequently meant a level of pragmatism that sacrificed otherwise really sexy principles and getting your hands dirty
This is a short overview of my thoughts but it dawned on me that these are a lot of calculations that wouldn t have sat well with me when I was younger and I m okay with that
This is an individualistic point for sure but if I can eventually have some influence on the direction the party takes and one disproportionate to what I d have in a sea of women young people or a bigger party this seems like the better choice on that end
We hit it off and I went to a few social gatherings
The numbers here work out in such a way that the party holds a lot of sway over local elections requiring several parties to court them
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Today I still value a lot of libertarian principles even if moderately
Again there is also an implicit alliance with the Republican Party whereas I think there s more room to spend time with frustrated Democrats
Also the numbers and demographics skew my way
I think it s going to take a lot of systemic massaging at a lower local level and this is one way to begin doing that
The Conservative Party in my experience has more latitude with the positions they adopt and direction they take because they are under no obligation to play ball
I registered Republican when I turned 18
I m more or less at peace with this but open minded to the fact that I might be giving up or selling out
Milton Friedman Hayek Rand were all in the works
My experience with the Libertarian Party remains the same a lot of political conversation not a lot of focus on problem solving as it applies to real life people and that might not lend itself to the prettiest picturesque outcome
I voted but lost interest in activism and discussion
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
It makes it difficult to identify completely with a Democratic platforms that otherwise embrace a lot of positions I like basic acknowledgment of some systemic and institutional inequality across race gender ethnicity
And that s the part I really don t understand and the reason I came to CMV maybe because I see podium women since I was a kid There s the argument of objectifying people but they are models which are pleased to do their job
On a recent event on my country only 2 out of 8 or 10 had good knowledge about the sport according to a TV report which only had the intent of talking a bit about those girls
There s a very recent example of podium men on a Norwegian race which sounds a fair way to balance the absence of men on the podiums of women s cycling and apparently would be a reason for people to say we re in a fair position
Yet people think the idea of podium men women is disgusting and distasteful
Yet we should consider that podium girls usually represent brands and they re a way of sponsoring a race and that would need to be rethought if we replaced them
And well if you disagree with me I want to know why you think I m wrong and I want you to change my view ____ Edit last sentence
and people think it s cute while being a much more embarrassing thing at the start
I really like to watch women s cycling and would really be pleased to see more of it on TV and the fact that women on the sport are more visible on the podium than on the bike is the problem IMO
My position is simple When the issue is brought to discussion I always end up concluding that the problem is the lack of TV coverage of women s cycling and not the concept of podium girls
The argument against podium women that I agree with is the fact that most of them don t know about cycling
Then there s the semantics podium girls sound quite worse than podium women which would sound much more reasonable and I agree with that let s change the name of it
I ve seen examples on twitter of happy parents talking about little girls thinking ooh I can do that too when La Course was on TV on the last day of Tour de France
Obviously there are some podium girls moments that belong on r cringe like but these are extreme examples which do not represent the majority
The subject of Podium girls is quite controversial on cycling subs good enough to generate all time top and controversial threads and I would like to know what people think about it
I ve seen riders a little more embarrassed when they had to greet politicians
Also it s a thing that takes seconds kisses are a way of congratulate people and how many times have we joked about it and created similar photos with our friends while having a good time Some argue that there s embarrassment between podium girls and the riders and that may be true but they re not displeased
And that is an example that there s a lack of coverage
Young riders or kids could be there on the podium congratulating the riders and meeting their heroes
Note that I m talking about cycling on other sports you can see examples that could be easily labeled as sexism which do not apply to the regular cycling podium even though I welcome your arguments if you talk about other sports
is among the most punitive countries out there in this regard
While significant chunks of the Constitution are dedicated to voting rights I realize there IS a clause in the 14th that allows states to disenfranchise felons
In many states in the USA convicted felons lose their right to vote and the loss of that right is sometimes permanent
I think this is especially important because of the implicit biases that are created by stripping felons of their voting rights felon disenfranchisement serves as a proxy for a racial bias in a similar way to voter ID laws
I can t think of one good reason for states to strip voters of that right especially considering that the U
So again my two in one CMV is that felons shouldn t lose their right to vote to begin with and that felons who ve lost the right to vote should regain it after serving their sentence
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I m looking forward to having my view changed thanks all Edit Grammar _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
If we go by raw numbers Hillary will most likely win the next election
I recently saw a video on why the Republicans the 2016 election
I don t see this trend changing so I have a hard time seeing how the a Conservative will be voted into office again
Has a situation like this happened before edit view is changed
This could be for a number of reasons like immigration but it s a good thing for the democrats because non whites are statistically more likely to be liberal
Firstly Non whites become a higher percent of the US population seemingly every year
I must be overlooking something or missing some way that Conservatives can get votes in the future
Statistically older people are typically more conservative whereas younger people are typically more liberal
The older Conservatives will eventually all die and be replaced by young liberals
Safety Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world
Bonus free time When I m in a train I can browse my phone read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone
I d have to pause my driving find a gas station and then resume it again why do that when you can go on the go
This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it
Potty Breaks trains can be modified to have them cars don t
It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system
Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars
Environmental impact A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment
3 Million people in the last decade
I am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate
Energy efficiency A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B
Some of the points I have against road transport for individuals
If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Here are some points that I have for expansion of public transport
Economy Transportation is lot more expensive in cars
Skill Transfer People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer
We should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars to making smarter faster safer public transport and expand the rail network
Stress While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days daily commute hardly is
According to WHO road injury took lives of 1
We already have it It s the trains If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly
Problems such as energy efficiency pollution and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have today
We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Maintenance a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components
Isn t he a really far left candidate This is a country where Trump is 1 currently among Republicans and to win the general election you have to appeal to moderates
I don t see how he can do that with a lot of the very liberal positions he s taken and my fear is that if some moderate Republican like Jeb Bush takes the nomination he will win a general election in a landslide by taking all the centrist votes
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
So much Sanders hype on Reddit lately yet despite some of the good ideas he has I don t want him to win against Hilary for the nomination
Or am I being too pessimistic _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
For hundreds of years if a writer or speaker was discussing a hypothetical person or a person whose gender they didn t know they would use the pronouns he etc
My primary view is that we should just embrace they as our gender neutral pronoun and use it in daily speech formal speeches articles essays etc
and the gender neutral singular use will be minimal especially since colloquially they pretty much already has this meaning
This just requires extra syllables ink and usually sounds forced at least to my ears
New words that catch on usually do so because they describe a new thing that lacks a word such as google selfie etc
Attempts have been made to come up with a gender neutral pronoun
Here s why 1 Every English speaker understands them without a problem and uses them fluidly
CMV _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Other writers or speakers alternate using he and him for one example then she and her for another
Sometimes you see people write or say His or her
This sometimes works but often trips up the reader causing them to reread sections
are the best gender neutral pronouns
Recently this is thought of as sexist since it obviously assumes that whoever the speaker is talking about is male
In everyday speech we often say things like Who left their shoes here Every student should place their test on the desk or similar things
I believe they them their etc
2 Any attempt to create a new word will never catch on
3 Any confusion between the plural use of they etc
However in English we already have a perfectly serviceable gender neutral pronoun they and its relatives
Compare those words to Bing s attempts to get people to say use bing as a verb in the same way we use google
Each of these has failed in that they have never caught on with the general populace so if someone uses them it causes confusion in the audience
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
If nothing else it usually stands out as a I m trying to not be sexist sign
I think people will probably also point out that some businesses will likely stay open and citizens will have to work anyway and thus be excluded from voting
This would be an incentive to shorter shifts and it would be treated like any other public holiday
Aside from picking apart my own argument I d greatly appreciate to hear what the arguments are in the US by people who don t want to have citizens take the day off on voting day
Also surely the people who won t be able to vote would be from a certain social class or demographic For example I m imagining that a single mother holding down two jobs won t be able to find the time to do what s required of her to support herself and her child in addition to having to find the time to vote
This is because people simply do not have the time People have to juggle a job family obligations basic errands needed to survive the day as well as transport and on top of this have to still make time to vote for their futures
I think the only people who won t vote would be people who didn t want to in the first place for particular reasons such as cynicism or apathy toward the democratic system not caring about who s in charge or no interest in the political system as they don t think it has an effect on their lives
In the case of it being a public holiday I imagine people will say that this will just be used as a day off to relax and people won t vote anyway
I m from a country where the day people vote is a public holiday
In many democratic countries the day citizens vote is a public holiday
Edit Thanks for clearing up a lot of misconceptions I had about the US which were present in what I wrote
In this case the majority of citizens will still be off work so this wouldn t be a complete argument against not having voting day a public holiday
This is not the case in the US where citizens have to vote before or after work or during a lunch break
In addition there would be a wider viewership of news networks and other sources of information as citizens would have more time to access this information
So it makes me wonder why one earth wouldn t the US not have voting day as a public holiday It seems like it stops people from voting and that it results in less ballots being cast
The people who have to work on voting day would most likely have shorter shifts as this is a public holiday and be allowed to vote
The lines are pretty long in some areas and the whole process can take a few hours even if you are quite early
I understand that I come from a different country so perhaps what I m saying isn t going to be particularly applicable to the US
On the other hand perhaps this is the wake up call that Americans need In any case I am greatly interested in discussion and would welcome the chance to change my view
Being that this would be a public holiday businesses would be forced to pay workers overtime
It seems counter intuitive and undemocratic in the sense that it makes the democratic process less accessible
I m not asking about bias
I m not asking about the politics of why he won t win
I m a liberal progressive young person with a low paying job and a college degree
What I m asking is why voting for Bernie Sanders would go against my interests
They all make mistakes voting for the wrong legislation for whatever reason
gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Or what ideas does he have or supported in the past that have gone against the progressive liberal ideals he supposedly stands for
What has he done EDIT what I mean by this question is what has Sanders done that doesn t live up to the ideology he has espoused
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
How has he contradicted what he s currently campaigning on What has he done in the past that would not live up to my standards No candidate is perfect
Basically I want to know how fake he is
I m of firm belief that no candidate can be all real all the time
But this is more or less inconsistent with his axioms and I don t think flies as a counterargument
The former is physics chemistry engineering and in general things we can measure or reproduce
We come to the conclusion that is either most likely requires the fewest assumptions or some other means of deciding which is best
I do not believe that he is right but I think that the arguments he makes are well thought out and properly reasoned assuming the the axiom that God is good God is great and the Bible is the word of God
By the way I m agnostic and believe in evolution and such
It s not fundamentally different from God is good God is great and the Bible is the word of God
I think his argument of why those didn t happen is logical
In fact it s pretty much just Bayesian statistics
The only hole I could really find with his argument was the assumption that the Bible was correctly transcribed for two centuries a series of events he could not have observed
I just happen to come to believe that the former set of axioms is better and disagree with the latter set of axioms
Most people including myself believe this is the most likely
So CMV Edit As clarification when I say he is intelligent it means that it is highly nontrivial to come up with and shape his arguments the way he does
Evolutionary biologists have of course constructed a large theory with which the gathered evidence is consistent
I either want to have MV C d or open other peoples minds about taking science gt religion as granted
It would be highly above say the capabilities of a typical Bible Belt redneck
I am not above believing science at its core is a set of axioms its main axiom is something along the lines of one cannot dispute that which is observed
We gather evidence and we add those to a prior
In fact it s the only logical conclusion
With the Bible in his prior the story as told in the Bible of course becomes the most likely and has the bonus of not requiring any assumptions other than the validity of the Bible as a source
This is motivated in part by a lot of CMVers with the notion that science is inherently superior to religion

For Ken Ham he includes the Bible in his prior
In the debate Ken Ham talks about the difference between observable sciences and unobservable sciences
The latter includes evolution Big Bang and all the other controversial stuff

Q But this means a bunch of bozos can come in and make a mockery of my church A Being respectful is not a protected class
I realize that this facet in particular is the most controversial part of my position
conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted My position is that the right to have freedom of religion does not superseed these rights
My position is that faith based organizations should not be given any special protection and should follow the same laws as every other organization with respect to discrimination against protected classes
Q But this means that churches would be forced to hire atheists as priests A Section 15
These quotations also aptly describe my position Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice
a of the Human Rights Act already allows for an exemption for positions established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement which I think would qualify here
If your religion is not able to be tolerant with respect to these rights then your religion has no place in our tolerant society
Bill Maher Some possible criticisms to this position and my response below Q But this means that churches would be forced to do Jewish ceremonies A This is not the case
EDIT Ok I have been reminded that in addition to the Human Rights Act the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establishes freedom of religion
Section 5 of the Human Rights Act states that discrimination occurs when someone is denied a provision of goods services facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public based on the above protected classes
This explains a lot of opposing views on this issue for me it seems that other people lean more toward the freedom of religion side whereas I lean more toward the Human Rights side
If someone is not being respectful of your church it is not discrimination to ask them to leave
Thus I think any violations of the Human Rights Act would have to be weighed on a case by case basis against the right to their religion
For the purposes of this discussion I am using the as the thing that defines discrimination
Since it would be impossible to satisfy both freedom of every religion and also my position above some balancing is necessary
The protected classes from this act are 1
Ayaan Hirsi Ali Don t get so tolerant that you tolerate intolerance
It is only discrimination if the service is generally available but specifically denied to a protected class
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
It s possible the driver went faster then paused before they crossed toll B but it would not be possible for them to have traveled at a legal speed and still pass through toll B within that time
The basis of this viewpoint is that a system that does not require an official review would also extend to other laws
That has set a precedent where it would be legally acceptable to issue fines to other violations without human input
If a driver passes through toll A then passes through toll B after 5 minutes it s possible to determine the driver s minimum speed as 120 mph

I believe everybody should have the right to vote and access to voting but when you re cajoling people into registering you re adding fluff votes based on color party or sensationalized issues
My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote they will most likely be too lazy to take the time to read up on their candidates or what they re voting for
I feel like most people I ve brought this up with believe I m wrong so I just want a well constructed argument as to why

That means anything dangerous is inherently bad and that is not true

Taking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous
The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace self harm with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure
Okay but it s a symptom of a bigger problem
Cooking is bad because it is dangerous
So I can not accept the false logic of dangerous bad
Sterilize tools clean and cover wounds etcetera
Of course this can still leave permanent scars but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing so once again self harm isn t inherently bad just because it leaves scars
It is dangerous because you could die or could get an infection
Thank you to those of you who have offered support and to those of you whose reasonings avoided condescension
But that still doesn t mean that the symptom is bad
Lots of things leave scars so scars aren t what s bad about it
Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous
Give me a real reason why self harm is bad
So self harm the symptom of many mood disorders isn t what should be treated
It is dangerous because you could get a concussion
So besides the ridiculously flawed it s dangerous argument explain to me why self harm is inherently bad
It is very easy to self harm without any danger
So far this is the logic I ve heard again and again Self harm is bad because it is dangerous

They are actually listed as top 10 dogs for families
Also there are numerous stories of staffy breeds sacrificing their lives for their families
This happens with all breeds but an aggressive Chihuahua doesn t make the news
If the dog doesn t have a strong pack leader the dog will become in some cases aggressive to both its family and others
I have researched the breed and talked to numerous people about owning this kind of dog
This is because of how gentle they are with children
So in conclusion I believe that staffys are sweet affectionate wonderful dogs Change my view
How are they then put forward as a dangerous breed children are the most vulnerable As in they can t physically protect themselves
Through my research I have realised that there is a stark contrast about how people feel about the breed
Staffys get a bad rap because of shitty owners who don t understand how to discipline a dog
To me this is not the dogs fault
On my team They are misunderstood
The breed is dominant and stubborn and they are not prepared for the work

New Delhi and Distrito Federal have oversized influence because a metric fuckton of people live there and in the surrounding suburbs

I believe that any church or religious meeting areas should have an age restriction
At a young age kids are impressionable and tend to believe whatever an adult parent says to them
Bringing children to church starting at a young age is very likely to make that person blindly follow that religion without them having much of a choice
I know that the parents could just teach them about it but hey if some people are going to indoctrinate their child might as well make them use their own time to do that
Thus the odds of them changing their beliefs are lowered
And not to make them not believe in religion that violates the constitution
I am not saying that they will never switch it s just the odds of them doing so are severely lowered
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Disclaimer I am very anti theist so that s why I have such a negative thought of bringing your kids to church

But to let them make the choice themselves and purely by themselves
In the time between me speaking to them and them calling me back I told my flatmate that we may need to go in for screening

This is where I made a mistake by saying don t be a fucking idiot
I was referred to the local chest clinic as potentially needing a booster and he was informed he did not need a booster as he already had a vaccination I followed up on my referral and was informed of the fact that TB only requires one jab to be immunised against although what we may have needed was screening if we had spent more than 10 hours with our friend within two weeks of her starting treatment
I argued that he owed it to everyone he comes into common contact with as well as himself to be certain if we had needed screening
I then heard back from the clinic ensuring us that we almost certainly didn t need screening which I accepted
I told him that we were in the clear and he left for work
She was informed by her doctor that anyone she spent more than 10 hours with would need to be screened for TB
When he got back in around an hour ago we were chatting in the kitchen when he said that he knew he didn t need to be screened as he knows when he s ill and he is not ill now
This was poorly explained as us needing a jab to prevent us contracting TB
We both went to our GPs and were told different things
The clinic told me that they would contact the local TB nurse and see if me and my flatmate required screening
I told him that he must go and reminded him of how bad of a shape our friend was in whilst in hospital
Now I hold my hands up and am willing to say that was wrong
tl dr CMV you can t be overcautious with TB and my friend is potentially dangerous when it comes to health related subjects
Essentially I need my view changed so I can apologise but as it stands I can t see how he s right
He said he didn t care and would not go to be screened as he had the vaccine and knew he can t have TB
Our friend who is now living with us recently had TB
If there was a possibility that he had TB and he travelled without it being addressed he d be putting himself and many others at risk he says that it doesn t matter to him
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things

In the case of property taxes they re already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own
First there s a fairness question since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are
If you own a plot with a value of 300 000 you should pay the same tax as any other owner of a plot valued at 300 000
Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move or to not sell when they don t have good use for the property such as _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
It should not matter what the use of the property is or who lives there

I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property

We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country
We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified
Otherwise why would they need help I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn t even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not despite my excellent grades and test scores
In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non black people become essentially racist and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic
I didn t even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities
My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace
I learned about the black crime rate and prison population
Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn t And if discrimination was the reason well my race was discriminated against in the past too This was opinion shared by my friends
Racial and diversity programs make people resentful and make the benefitting parties feel entitled
If you didn t know Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action
Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS
So basically I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans rather than african american asian american etc racism would soon become a thing of the past
When I went to college I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences
As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal
I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets
I started paying attention to the news and the internet
I started to see lines forming
I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat
White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did
They start noticing and being hyper aware of differences between races
If I hadn t heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as Man those specific people suck rather than lump the entire race together
I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues
People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions instead of saying hey those are just bad people
All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion
I started to resent black people for this
It led us to think that if this was the case black people didn t try very much and were lazy in school
I also want to understand why not seeing color is ridiculed
We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist
I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil
It wasn t anything dramatic no one attributed this to the things we were being taught but people knew they were different now
Black kids were taught that they were owed something
As I grew older my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else
People should be chosen on merit alone
Not seeing color is treated as ignorant and is laughed at but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems
I d like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me
I saw how violent black neighborhoods are I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything
I don t want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race
If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race rather than as Americans
In this post I am going to be very blunt
Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism
I heard about the riots and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became
I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them
I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent
I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice
This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me
I noticed kids start self segregating
Even if the blame doesn t lie on McDonalds the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest
The facts are McDonalds brewed coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170 180F McDonalds has NOT lowered the temperature of their coffee nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee To me the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they re buying near boiling water when they decided hey I want coffee
I ve read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald s lawsuit many times
I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald s in any way shape or form
EDIT Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case
But to argue as some have that this should replace the traditional algebra to calculus high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English
Finally learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields which statistics training will not replace
Thus BOTH statistics and math as separate disciplines should have a role in the high school curriculum
I m well aware that bad mathematics teaching is rampant in the U
In a well taught algebra geometry or calculus class by contrast students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence solve non routine problems and use mathematics of all types to analyze real world phenomena
Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much I believe this premise has empirically denied so these arguments are not convincing to me
Although the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence
As a final note I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught well
Others have made the point that in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses
While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum and both are necessary for a complete education
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
so I d prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best case possibilities of both subjects
I have re thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem solving skills
None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum
I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math rather than as an optional class within the math department
Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines
Obviously a well taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly taught math class and vice versa
As a separate issue I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here
Thank you again to all who responded
But there are alternatives to the algebra geometry trig calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals
To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts thank you also for your participation in the conversation
Increasingly many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum
EDIT Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions
You can argue that a deep facility with abstract math has little importance in the real world but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem solving even if you are never directly using specific skills
This is a more compelling argument but ultimately a risk I am willing to take since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course
I agree with this wholeheartedly as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century
At the high school level the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts the appropriate use of technology and interpretation you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate precise probablistic statement and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement
These are important skills but they aren t really mathematical skills in the traditional sense you are reasoning in a different mode
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things

I emailed the recruiter I had been in contact with multiple times to change schedule but he never emailed me back until after I missed the call and it was just a template email to mention that I seemed to have missed the call
The manager seemed to really like me and he insured me that I would make it to the next step of the process I need only wait to hear back from them to get it scheduled
You can get things for virtually free if you choose and time your bids strategically
But then you might not even find that item on Amazon at all which is much worse
My view is held up by these points so you will have to remove more than one of the supports to get it to collapse
I suppose somebody could also argue why amazon is actually superior to ebay or why I should like amazon more than ebay but I m not sure I can anticipate the form or content that those arguments would take
EDIT1 To argue against point 1 you are going to have to provide specific examples and prove that the majority of amazons prices are lower than ebay which I have found to not be the case even by a longshot
A lot of sellers on amazon do this too but you have already lost shipping and might even have to pay shipping again for a new item
I applied for an amazon job many say that is my first mistake
So I changed my schedule and made it work
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
You can buy things from anywhere and often that place is China
Most sellers will just send you another one gratis but I ve never once been refused a refund or even argued with
It s just anecdotal but I can t say it doesn t influence my view so it s here Applying for an entry level tech support job with them was one of the most annoying and dehumanizing experiences that I ve had in the job market
The calls ends up coming at 10 30 AM with no mention of the scheduled time or any apologies on the manager s part
A year later I got another email from the same recruiter saying he found my newest resume online and would like to set up an interview with me
Weeks go by after the application until I get a template email from an amazon recruiter in India who insists on calling me by my middle name and tells me simply that Your interview has been scheduled for tomorrow at 9 AM
When I replied back that I d requested a rescheduling or at the very least some input on when to conduct the interview I never got a response
Consistently lower prices I don t think this one needs any explanation
Why aren t more people aware of this It takes a little longer but you pay less and get what you want
This time I had another job interview for a company equally as prestigious as amazon on the exact day and time I was to receive the call
If you ve been on the front page recently I m sure you read the article about how much it sucks to work there
Two methods of buying On ebay you can either Buy it Now or bid on items
Seriously you can buy almost anything from China at a lower price and with free shipping through ebay
Larger selection of items and larger market of sellers for each item This one is pretty self explanatory also
They ask you questions to see if you know the first thing about computers then they ask you some more technical things like how DHCP works or what the different layers of the OSI model actually mean in real life
When you buy it now the price is almost always lower than the lowest listing on amazon and when it isn t the cost of shipping at amazon still makes the total cost higher
They only have 5 European markets and zero in Asia
The interview goes how most other interviews in this industry go
Nothing too out of the ordinary so I nailed every answer
I also have an experience of trying to get a job there that is pretty bad also
It is also a global pawn shop that doesn t skimp you
The seller will almost always say that they are sorry and they would be happy to refund you your money
Plus Amazon has some big faults that ebay just doesn t have
Bidding is a goldmine for those with the know how or just the luck
EDIT2 Also I thought it went without saying but in order to change my view you will have to successfully argue against more than one point
Refund policy If your item comes damaged or doesn t work it is effortless to get a refund
I need to list the main reasons that motivate my view attacks on these being the most likely method of actually getting it to change
I email back asking if there are other times or if we could try another day
So yeah if you made it this far I m sure you have something worthwhile to say about this subject so attempt to change my view Ebay is clearly superior to amazon
Free shipping on any product you want Except extreme niche items where there are only one or a handful of sellers
Little did I know I would be waiting 3 more weeks only to be given another Your interview is this time and this day only ultimatum and that was to take place another week from the date of the email
Market is more global which contributes significantly to global economic integration Amazon is a much smaller player in the global market than Ebay
You can find almost anything on ebay and you have many more sellers to choose from than you would with the same item at amazon

An article I read in trying to understand why this is the case used the analogy of an insurance company paying out for crutches but not surgery in the event of a broken leg
Can anyone CMV as to why insurers shouldn t cover laser eye surgery gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
However insurance does not cover any of the various laser eye surgery options Lasik Lasek or PRK
The only argument I can see for not covering laser surgery is a question of cost to the insurer but I m not sure how much of the case that is
Assuming that laser surgery doesn t have complications the insurer doesn t need to keep shelling out for continued eye exams and continued glasses or contacts
This makes absolutely no sense to me
This is a pretty straightforward CMV
It s often classified as a cosmetic procedure along the lines of botox or liposuction
In the US most vision insurance will cover at least part of glasses or contacts
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Rather than talk about what can be done to help Palestinians the organization takes it as a given that BDS is the best way to help Palestinians and focuses discourse on why we need BDS
However it is far from the only factor
I openly acknowledge that it is possible to criticise Israel or disagree with the existance of Israel without anti Semitic motives
Israel s actions are of course an important component of the situation
I support a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict
actions by individuals do occur but they are punished appropriately by the Israeli government
Israel has a legitimate functioning democratic system and people are free to interface with it like they would any other
But when one of the creepy old men in the back stands up and gets a liiiiiittle too passionate about how much he adores the winner of the 8 10 years old category
I mean I m sure most of the people there are well meaning individuals and the topics discussed were technically anti Zionist and not anti Semitic but the phrasing tone delivery really just the overall vibe left me feeling very uncomfortable
But talking to my Jewish friends at schools all over the country has reassured me that I am far from alone in this feeling
This is a noble goal and I am absolutely in favor of improving the living conditions
Maybe we meet every week and flip through pictures of winners and admire them maybe discuss their strengths and weaknesses
First I d like to bring up a point about the mission of the BDS movement
EDIT Further I believe that the BDS movement exists primarily as means of converting well meaning liberal college students into anti Zionists under a veneer of pro Palestinian rhetoric
Rather than just having the goal of improving lives for the Palestinians it is important to note that the BDS movement specifically wants to accomplish this through criticising Israel
SECOND ARGUMENT BDS PROMOTES ANTI SEMITISM Anti Zionism is not the same as anti Semitism
If it were just my personal experience it wouldn t be enough to convince me that BDS is anti Semitic
However I acknowledge that my own personal views will probably play into this so here they are for context I m a Jewish American college student and have attended both pro Israel and BDS events on my campus
Again I do not disagree with the idea of economic sanctions when implemented correctly
They pretend that they want justice for the Palestinian people but people who join the organization because they support that cause are instead indoctrinated with anti Zionist ideas
The BDS movement is a tool to manipulate college students into believing and spreading anti Zionist propaganda
I believe that the Israeli government is not a fundamentally flawed government although of course as is true for any democracy I do of course disagree with some of its policies
What this amounts to is of course criticising Israel
The method used by the BDS movement is well BDS Boycott Divestment Sanction i
Secondly I d like to make a criticism of the methods of the BDS movement
Its fundamental flaws are so overwhelming that rather than try to fix it I will simply try to get rid of it
com 2015 02 04 religious chants at uc davis debate raise concerns after jewish fraternity house vandalized Can I offer 100 proof that the BDS movement is promoting these anti Semitic actions intentionally or unitentionally No
There s nothing inherently wrong with that even if some people are weirded out by them childhood beauty pageants are not immoral and admiring the winners I guess is okay too
I believe that Israel fundamentally has a right to exist and deserves the monetary support given to it by the US
I will sacrifice all good things I could potentially gain from it because I wish it were not here
But I believe that people who support Boycott Divestment and Sanction efforts are intentionally or not de legitimizing Israel and that supporting BDS is irrevocably linked to denying the right to exist of Israel
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Thus though BDS is marketing itself as an organization for people who believe in Justice for Palestinians it is really an organization for people who believe Israel Should Not Exist
However to me the true purpose of these actions is to de legitimize the state
If you ll pardon my detouring briefly into the realm of personal experience this is how I felt when attending meetings of the BDS movement on my campus
To give a medicore metaphor Imagine we held a weekly meeting called Appreciating Beauty in Children where we discuss and admire childhood beauty pageants all over the world
The living conditions in Gaza are terrible and I fully support all humanitarian efforts there however I believe that Israel is doing everything that it reasonably can be expected to do to provide aid to the Palestinians and that things like the checkpoints are necessary for national security
Please note that the Israeli Palestinian conflict is NOT the focus of my argument and not what I wish to discuss here
I mean he isn t definitely a pedophile but if you were the father of an 9 year old girl and you heard about this happening you would probably feel a bit uncomfortable about sharing a campus with those guys
Now I am not saying that criticizing Israel as a step towards a solution is wrong I m simply noting that there do exist other avenues of activism that are explicitly ignored by BDS
This is because the act of boycotting anything is a strong statement I so wholeheartedly believe that this should not exist that I will live my life as though it did not exist
However that being said Israel is evil and or should not exist is one view that I would wager every single anti Semitic person shares
Attending a weekly echo chamber of people that share many of their opinions on Jews will reinforce ALL of their opinions on Jews
One for the anti Zionistic nature of BDS and one for the anti Semitic nature of BDS
Israel is a democracy and a good one it was ranked 37th best in this study on corruption https www
I have very little doubt that there were some true anti Semites mixed into that crowd and that they were being validated and supported in their beliefs by their time at the event
Similar protests could and should be aimed at the other nearby countries all of whom could also be pressured to help support shelter or aid Palestinians
They claim that this is for economic sanctions and that it will hurt the Israeli economy enough that they are forced to make a policy change to end it
What the above two points come down to is this what goes on at a BDS meeting is criticism of Israel and Israelis with the objective of proving that Israel does not have a right to exist
not buying Israeli made goods or supporting Israeli companies
FIRST ARGUMENT BDS IS ANTI ZIONIST The stated goal of the BDS movement is to respect the rights of the Palestinian people by changing Israeli policy
However the actual implementation of the movement especially on college campuses differs
I d like to make two separate arguments here
This fact creates a certain discourse within the BDS movement
Worse there are several documented cases of waves of anti Semitic actions immediately following BDS victories

If someone in a European country disagreed with one of the USA s policies the solution wouldn t be to boycott all products produced in the USA instead people would write letters to their government vote for politicians with foreign policies that they align with etc
A meeting for anti Zionists though not inherently anti Semitic will absolutely be something that every anti Semite around wants to be a part of
We are trying to limit water waste but seem to overlook the waste generated by every diner whether they will drink it or not being provided a glass of water sometimes even an additional carafe on the table
I drink soda and will leave water completely untouched if it is provided
This practice should be halted in order to reduce water waste
It s brought out even before drink orders are requested
We re all advised to limit water usage and waste by turning the tap off while brushing our teeth
As many probably know my area of the country is in a prolonged drought that has led to water rationing limits on car washing and lawn watering etc
Throughout my lifetime in the southwestern US I have been provided with water at restaurants whether I requested it or not
I certainly think water should be provided for free but I see no reason that it should be provided preemptively rather than upon request
Often despite my not requesting it I ve been brought a glass of water along with my glass of soda
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I have been traveling eating out a lot recently and have been observing many other diners who do not drink the water provided for them because they opt for alcohol or soda
Furthermore the extra glass that I did not need will now need to be washed leading to more wasted resources including more water

This also reminds me of a similar problem with religious belief
So just like getting a tattoo people suddenly become much more aggressive about defending the practice in the face of even mild disagreement
To a certain degree I think I can understand why this might be
I ve noticed this in person but it is even more apparent on reddit
Almost anywhere on reddit if there is a comment that gets popular that mentions something good about not having children or something bad about having children it seems there will soon be people replying stuff like Geez apparently all of the child haters are out on reddit today
It is kind of like getting a tattoo
Unless you re willing to be practically socially ostracized then once you have a child there is no going back
I find this to be an oddly aggressive pushback considering parents often spend a huge amount of time advertising to others exactly how amazing their children are
Where people will share their deepest religious convictions in public and make definitive statements about how the universe works and then respond with an out sized reaction when someone posts something about how they don t really think any of that makes much sense
Being a parent is something that only goes one direction
Unless you re extremely frugal or enjoy building PCs you re better off just buying an OEM PC
I decide that the PCIe slot is broken and take the pc apart to get the board ready to RMA
I decide I need a PC while I wait for the new parts so I reassemble my old build which took even more time
The 100 200 you save isn t worth the work it takes to assemble the thing and troubleshoot faulty parts
Put in spare card works fine
Package arrives I take a couple hours to assemble it as the cooler is a bit tricky
Not surprising because the GPU won t show in the device manager
The time spent troubleshooting poor parts isn t worth the miniscule amount of money you save
The build process is all fine if you know what you re doing and all parts work but the moment you get 1 DOA part that fries other parts then it s pure hell to figure out what to replace and what to keep
They would have no clue what part to blame what to RMA what to buy
There s a reason that professional corporations just buy OEM PCs like Dell instead of hiring people to build them
I ve been working in a PC repair shop for a year took a year long pc repair course and I m comptia A certified so I know what I m doing for the most part
But this PCIe slot operates at x8 and isn t big enough to fit high end GPUs because the SATA ports are in the way
So I install windows just fine
System boots image displayed but now the video card fans don t spin
So now I m down 600 I spent on new parts 2 days worth of time I spent troubleshooting and now I m stuck using a low end GPU as the motherboard fried my 200 one
Try to get drivers off of AMD s site install fails
I then take that spare GPU and put it in the 2nd PCIe slot
Obviously this means that the card is overheating due to no active cooling
But imagine if this happened to a beginner who is just going off of guides found online with no experience behind them in troubleshooting
System restarts after a few minutes abruptly
So I look online and people tell me I probably just need drivers
I was short on cash so I decided to reuse the same GPU for now 100 functional before I built the new PC
I don t think building a PC is worth it unless you enjoy the process of doing so
But I get it right but the system only outputs to the onboard VGA
Onboard DVI and GPU outputs don t work but the GPU fans are spinning
So I had a 100 functional pc I built years ago and decided I d rebuild it with a skylake CPU new motherboard new cooler ddr4 RAM
The 100 200 yous ave isn t worth the time spent figuring it out or the risk that you ll never get it to work at all
So the new motherboard I bought fried the video card I own due to a falty PCIe slot and chances are Newegg or ASUS won t cover that judging by what I read online
So I turn it off open it up and put a spare GPU into the same slot
Yes the PCIe power connectors are connected and yes I properly seated the GPU
If there is a victim there is a crime
So why are so many websites banning such content on Legal Grounds _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Similarly I do believe that possession and distribution of child pornography is a punishable crime
Yet they are penalised if found out What have they done wrong In a similar strain I believe lolicon should be legal as there is no victim
Both of these are protected by free speech and neither have a victim
We also see many pedophiles being penalised simply for being a pedophile regardless of whether or not they ve acted upon their urges
For many years homosexuals were penalised and even killed simply for being a homosexual regardless of whether they acted upon their urges or not
Possessing child porn means you condone the acts depicted
It is my belief that only criminals should be punished for crimes
Even if they have not performed an illegal act
If someone is revealed to be a pedophile they are instantly put on the sex offenders list
There ARE child molesting pedophiles of course and I do believe they should be reprimanded
There are many pedophiles who have not committed a crime such as molestation or looked at child porn
If anything they provide an outlet for sexual frustration
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
This does not mean they are worse undesirable or negative
Nor does it mean they are better desirable or positive
This means that states such as Transgender Homosexual Autistic etc
By the above definition we can be sure that there is a Normal human being
and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal
Or at the very least various Normal states to make up a Normal human being
Normal Conforming to the standard or common type
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Anything that is in the majority is a Normal state
So the Normal human being is a Cisgendered Heterosexual Chinese man
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
It s hard to find someone who hasn t read Of Mice and Men the Catcher in the Rye Catch 22 and a bunch of Shakespeare stuff from middle high school _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Why do themes matter Why should students learn about literature in the past when we learn about the past from History Dr
While they don t all always the biggest thing teachers enjoy is pointing out the themes behind each book
My reasoning behind this is for the most part the above authors lack lessons
You could stretch for several lessons but they re mostly reiterations of the themes
So in order to not completely hate the school system and rant at my teacher and probably not do any homework based on the theme based literature CMV
Not just themes in the world we can relate to but how to not be a dick or how to plant a tree or stay creative while aging seem pretty important
Not sure how other countries do their classes but our English classes have mandatory books read throughout the country
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I m not picking out those authors exclusively they re just some examples I thought of since I ve read some of their works and I was disappointed because I m in school to learn and most of these books are rather dull and don t teach me anything besides themes that parallel from human nature back then to now
So I feel like the school system is failing me by dulling me down with pointless theme based literature rather than literature with lessons and morals that could prepare us for the world we re gonna face
It s annoying reading Of Mice and Men and seeing all of these themes about friendship and loyalty in the great depression and not coming out a better person after reading it
Being yourself being creative not being an asshole caring about the planet etc
I can quickly pick up on someone s mood energy and read through their body language
I know the people around me whose help I often need like my garbage collector the grocery store owner some neighbours my landlady
But now that I m out of the university I realise how futile those relationships actually are
Whenever I need domestic help they come to my rescue
I am repulsed by how much human fakery people do just to keep relationships intact
I still stick to my handful of close friends
What am I missing really by not socialising with tangible people I learn a lot from Reddit and my Internet friends just as much _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Sometimes we talk about our lives but not too much
I can go about the rest of my life without meeting any one of them ever again
Yes I made a lot of casual friends and acquaintances but when I need help I don t and won t really call any of them
I ve met lots of people in college because of all the classes I took and all the organisations I joined
And I usually am the one who asks and listens because I am not keen on revealing so much about myself
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
I can also strike up a conversation with strangers just fine
In fact I can at times be too enthusiastic when meeting new people
I have a pretty good surface level relationship with them
But the thing is I am very empathic
More people making more money leads to more business for all companies and more tax revenue for cash strapped local state and federal governments
Walmart wouldn t be the only company doing this though most of the biggest companies would be doing the same with their sudden surpluses which would lead to a labor shortage which would drive up salaries and benefits for the average workers
Simply put I think that many of America s economic problems could be fixed by placing a cap on total compensation for executives let s say 5 million
Bonus The super wealthy will no long be willing to make such huge political contributions
Let me start by saying that I am not an economics expert and I m sure it s probably not as simple and obvious as it seems or we would ve done this by now
So with a 5 mil wage cap wal mart would have over 20 mil in surplus cash which it would then logically invest into more warehouses factories and stores creating more jobs
Who would drop 50 mil on a candidate who might not even win if it ll take them a decade to earn that money back _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
This would have no effect on small businesses of course but would have a major positive impact on major corporations like for instance wal mart
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
According to site wal mart paid it s top 6 execs just over 50 million combined
Feel free to correct me if I am wrong but for all of human history up until recently people regularly married people in their late teens and they were seen as adults
Many adults don t make very adult decisions and many teens make responsible adult decisions
They were and are both very happy and have a good marriage
Also I do not believe that such relationships hurt anyone by default
I did not know this was an unpopular opinion until recently
People now marry later in life the norm in this culture is to sleep around when they are younger
Society s rules are nothing in the face of objective truth If they are not molded after it already
I think the change in perception can be attributed to three things 1
Which is probably the source of aversion to this kind of attraction because they want to protect them
As a result people more readily assume that anyone interested in a younger person is up to no good and isn t serious
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
So basically the only thing I see that supports the argument against my view is that culture opposes it
So it is normal to be attracted to them and the current taboo is only a recent arbitrary social rule based on nothing more than culture
ELI5 TLDR People in their late teens many times cannot be differentiated from other adults if you did not know their age
While culture and soceity s rules may be influenced by truth they are arbitrary
Probably a result of people getting married later in life which is a result of promiscuity due to culture and availability of contraception
Basically my stance is as follows
I m also not looking to hook up I m a actually abstaining from sex until marriage and take all my relationships seriously no spring flings or whatever for me
In the past people may have been more serious about relationships but nowadays a lot of people just hook up and marry when they want to settle down later in life
One person may be more inexperienced but that is a vulnerability that the other person does not have to exploit if they are a decent human being after the right thing
Its why in the past men were legally considered minors at a later age than women were
Imagine if they had dismissed each other as unavailable or were prevented from being together
This is instead something to assess regarding the individual which applies to people 20 as well
If you make the argument that someone cannot rightfully enter a relationship with an adult until their brain is fully mature you would be forced to also agree that 17 y o women should be available and that men should not be available until 23
My grandparents met and started dating when grandma was 16 and grandpa was 21
My own solution to this is that maturity in decision making is not wholly dependent on this one variable
I feel that this is normal and natual and not a fetish or somehing that is uncommon
People in their late teens are fully physically developed and have all the qualities that other adults find sexually appealing
I think this could be a result of how present society coddles people even through their college years whereas many later year teens have the potential to be a functional adult with a job spouse and kids if raised differently
Adding on to this I ve heard that women s brains become fully mature at 17 and men s brains become fully mature at 23
They are sexual beings both physically and mentally
People nowadays do not consider people in their late teens to be adults while in the past they were
I do not get off on domination or whatever like some people think those who have this attraction do
Furthermore I would actually assert that forbidding relationships based on age given that both are ready physically and mentally for that kind of relationship is immoral because you are stepping in the way of love no one is getting hurt etc
I just find that my brain recognizes those people as fellow adults
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
So it is evident to me that the Natural Order of Things supports my view
A bit of context I m a 21 y o college student and do find myself attracted to people in their late teens as well as adults
Uruguay can get this educated american and could benfit from having a better working and promote american immigration also many less competent countries promote more competent countries immigration which doesn t happen often besides these countries also are often more open to many crimes that more competent nations are not This is coming way too often if you are skeptical of the fact that there are unfair life long jail sentences here read if TL DR 1000 plants of cannabis 1g of LSD or 50g of meth can get you life sentence This is in light of United States condemming Venezuela s Presidents decision to exile Leopoldo Lopez This post is reuploaded thanks for the comments and keep them coming I m not suggesting exiling serial killers or others of the sort just for minor offences sending them to places where this is legal and give them the option for jail or exile Feel free to correct my grammar _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
For the many People asking about which countries would accept them consider this example USA has a several times drug offender who could get 55 years of jail or be exiled to Uruguay
Coming from a country that used to do this a lot I believe that it would be way better than using jailtime
In the end I just believe that getting rid of criminals by exiling them rather than placing them in jail is cheaper and better overall for the country
EDIT By exile I refer to banning them to the country as if in you cannot re enter this country by any means
A regular prisioner costs around 30 000 USD per year and by exiling them out of the country not only do you save all that money you also get rid of the part of the population that was breaking the law the part you want to get rid off
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
It has been bothering me a lot recently but I just can t reconcile the two ideas
I am not arguing that they are bad
Rather what I am arguing is that upon reading the constitution they or parts of them sound unconstitutional specifically because of the 10th amendment
I have been trying to reconcile the two ideas that what the constitution says is important and that the things mentioned above although not explicitly authorized by the Constitution are good
The 10th amendment says gt The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people
I like these things and am glad they exist
This sounds like it would exclude a lot of things namely things not mentioned in or any of the amendments which grant congress the Federal government other powers to enact laws
I know the constitution can be open to a wide array of interpretations so please CMV
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
To name a few regulating pollution regulating nuclear waste protecting endangered species social security regulating certain business practices protecting worker health and safety disaster relief etc
First off I really do like the United States government and support a lot of the things it does
The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6 000 square kilometers of land
The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27 000 square Kilometers of land that s more land than even Isreal has
The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal
The people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine
If a buffer line zone were felt to be necessary it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians
One could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too
Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt
Irrigation agriculture forestry and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification
Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region s development
There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt Israel and Palestine all agreed to this
Albeit it s extremely unlikely this will ever happen but I think it would be a good solution
If necessary Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state

I just had my dad tell me to lower my voice during an argument but often I m not even aware I m raising it
When you re angry you re by definition unable to be calm and yet people treat it as some sort of heinous fault
wrt parents who can t stay under the same roof without shouting at each other
I personally don t think raising your voice during an argument is a bad thing when you re angry you often can t talk calmly and it s fucking stupid to call someone out on something that s completely normal to do when they re upset particularly in the way that my dad called me out namely Am I raising my voice I m talking to you in a normal voice
I suppose this is as much a rant as a CMV so sorry if this isn t in the right sub
I think it s a normal reaction and it shouldn t be seen as something we need to tone down
Edit Regarding the bit about the children I meant more in the sense of scaring traumatising the child with constant loud arguments e
The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship and that these guys are frustrated critical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns
Single guys suffering deserve as much respect and empathy as women who may face different challenges
_____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
Also these guys are often being vulnerable to their crushes and trying to start a romantic relationship
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
Even if the other party isn t interested it s brave of them and they shouldn t be mocked for their courage
All it does is alert people to the possible repercussions of the content to follow
A trigger warning is effectively just the passage of information from one party to another
Tw this might upset people who become overly aggressive about trigger warnings
Be careful to note that I am not saying it is okay to vindictively attack those who do not use trigger warnings I am merely saying that there is a reason why we have things like rating systems
Again this is not to say people don t attack others because they don t use trigger warnings that s a different argument though because that s on them
We are trying to protect people by informing them of content that could be bad and expecting them to act appropriately on that information
It is no different from an R rating on a movie an M rating on a video game or a TV MA rating on a show
So I don t get why someone would hold such a person in high acclaim when the same people would most likely be horrified by the actions in the modern day _____ gt Hello users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators
I don t get why so many people in the UK think he is so great
could easily be mistaken for something out of ISIS
So on one of the digital channels they were repeating that BBC Greatest briton thing and one of the top runners was Oliver Cromwell
We d just like to remind you of a couple of things
He was downright brutal during the civil war starving out towns that were Royalist and after he managed to get rid of Charles I he basically installed himself as a king Then you have his actions that he did in Ireland where he committed genocide and tried to wipe out Catholicism in the British Isles and wanted to impose his own puritanical form of fundamentalist Protestantism some of his laws such as banning Christmas and Birthdays making women cover up etc
To nip in the bud a follow up to the above statement I realize making it financially ADVANTAGEOUS would create a cobra market
I believe the goal of centrist populist pro lifers so EXCLUDING the extreme radical holders is to minimize abortions not maximize children
Abortion is often a more financially advantageous position compared to putting a child up for adoption
I offer a critique on the angle of the traditional pro life lobby
So I believe for someone who is seriously pro life it should be seen as a step in the right direction to obtain that goal by eliminating reasons why a person would or should choose to end a pregnancy
I also believe forcing women who have been raped or are in risky pregnancies to complete their births is wrong
And thus contraception poses no ethical qualms with the above viewpoint
Yes I know that the Witcher mutagens are supposed to strip away emotion
I can watch Iron Man without reading a comic and Lord of the Rings without cracking open a book
How on Earth this guy gets lumped in with Joel or Clementine or Elizabeth or any other legitimately well written characters simply stuns me
I played through the entire first game got 20 hours into the second game and stopped playing the third one at 54 hours
If you re doing a medium transfer from book to movie movie to game etc you must make your material accessible to the new audience
Not only is it unmemorable but even when I did know what was going on I didn t care
The Witcher 3 has a much better handle on characters Triss particularly is a lot more interesting because we see her beaten down and tired after leaving the royal court
The games are also largely in dire need of an editor preferably one armed with a flamethrower and a HAZMAT suit they re WAY too long contain so much needless side story and all this bullshit just becomes unmemorable
My biggest complaint is Geralt himself
I really really wanted to like these games
But I can t even finish 2 3 of the games because in my view their writing is just dull overlong and has a major problem with investment
You can say I should have read the books but that s not an excuse
He s honestly in no small way a Mary Sue he has no weaknesses he kicks ass at pretty much everything he s best pals with pretty much every king in the realm and the entire universe seems to revolve around him
Second major problem is that the Witcher games seem to be a master at talking a lot but never actually saying anything
His delivery is awful he can t emote for shit his motivations are both confusing and often not sympathetic and he is horribly unengaging
The animations in TW3 also work to its advantage it s a very beautiful game and that serves the characters very well when they re trying to convey emotion even Geralt almost smiles at one point or another
I didn t figure out until 30 hours in why Salamandra were the bad guys I still don t know why Alvin was so important or why Triss was so obsessed with him I remember meeting the King of the Wild Hunt but I couldn t tell you who he was or why he was there etc
The Bloody Baron storyline although frankly it s completely unnecessary and serves as little more than needlessly long padding is another good example
I d just finished with Mass Effect 3 a series which blew my mind by the time I picked up the first Witcher and I was in a big RPG kick at the time
